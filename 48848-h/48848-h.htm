<h2>Frank Armstrong at Queen's.</h2>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER I.</span><span class="subtit">FRANK ENCOUNTERS A BULLY.</span></h2>

<p>"Can you tell me how to get to Warren Hall,
please?"</p>

<p>The question was addressed by a slender youth
of fourteen to a group of lads lolling on the grass
at the foot of a great elm in the yard of Queen's
School.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess the best way would be to walk,
unless you have an automobile," was the flippant
answer of a freckle-faced and aggressive member
of the group, who, lying with his hands under his
head, gazed up at the questioner with an impish
grin. The rest of the crowd laughed loudly at the
sally.</p>

<p>"I mean," said the newcomer, visibly embarrassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
with this unkindly reception, "in which direction
is Warren Hall?"</p>

<p>"Follow your nose and your two big toes, kid,
and you'll get there all right," was the rude response
from the self-appointed guide, and at this
several of the recumbent youths rolled around on
the ground with laughter. It was great, this exhibition
of wit. Chip Dixon considered himself
brighter than the morning sun, and through a
certain strength of his own held sway over his
satellites, some of whom were with him this particular
afternoon.</p>

<p>The boy asking for information, at the second
rebuff looked the speaker coolly in the eye. His
embarrassment had gone now, and in its place
came a look of disdain. He threw his head back.</p>

<p>"I asked for Warren Hall because I'm going
there, and I'm not sure which one it is, but this
smart fellow," indicating Chip, "doesn't have
sense enough to answer a straight question. Can
anyone tell me?" He cast his eye around the
group. A look of amazement that a new boy
should dare to cross words with this rough and
ready fire-eater, spread over the faces of several
of them, and a titter ran around, for Chip was
not over well liked in the school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Before anyone had time to answer, Chip himself
sprang to his feet with clenched fists. He
liked to say sharp things, but like many others,
young and old, he could not stand his own medicine,
and the titter angered him no less than the
cool looking boy who had drawn it forth.</p>

<p>"Smart, am I?" he yelled, rushing up to the
newcomer. "I'll show you whether I'm smart
or not," and he pushed his face up close to that
of the new boy, who held his ground bravely in
the rush of the fellow who evidently meant fight.
In an instant the two were surrounded.</p>

<p>"Ow! ow!" yelled Chip, just at the moment he
appeared to be ready to land his fist on the unoffending
boy, "ow! ow! I'll kill you for that,"
and he grabbed one of his feet and danced around
on the other in agony. The heavy suit case, which
the newcomer carried had been dropped on the
toes of Chip's thin pumps, and must have hurt
cruelly. And it looked as if it had been dropped
intentionally.</p>

<p>"I'll pay you for that, you fresh kid," and
Chip made another rush.</p>

<p>"Cheese it, Chip, here's Parks. Cut it out."</p>

<p>Chip subsided quickly, assumed an air of easy
indifference, and began to talk with those of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
cronies nearest to him as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Parks, the assistant master of the
school, and a martinet for discipline, was swinging
rapidly down the walk, unaware that anything
out of the ordinary was taking place. He
was a young man in appearance, perhaps not
over thirty-five, but he had trained for the army,
and showed it in his bearing. A railroad accident
had deprived him of his left arm, and as
army service was impossible for him, he took up
the work of teaching. He nodded pleasantly to
the boys as he approached them, and then stopped
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Hello, Armstrong," he said with surprise, as
he saw the strange lad standing there, "I was
just going across to your room. Been talking
with your father on the telephone and I promised
him I'd see you settled all right. He said that he
had been unable to come up with you, but described
you so well I knew you at once. Glad
you fell in with friends, though," added Mr.
Parks, glancing around the circle of faces.</p>

<p>"They are not friends of mine. I was just
asking for directions when you came up," answered
Frank, for the new boy was none other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
than Frank Armstrong. He had made up his
mind to enter Queen's in the fall term after all,
and as his health was so robust owing to the
great vacation he had had at Seawall and in the
Everglades, his mother and father offered no
objections, and so here he was faring forth alone.</p>

<p>"They have given you a room in Warren Hall,
I believe, haven't they?" said Mr. Parks.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; eighteen is the number."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"No, a fellow named Gleason is with me, from
New York State, I think. I don't know him."</p>

<p>"Well, come along," said Mr. Parks, and led
the way in the direction of Frank's future domicile.</p>

<p>"So that's Frank Armstrong, is it?" growled
Chip, still with his feathers ruffled from the setback
he had received. "I've heard of him and
he's what I call a pretty fresh guy. If old Parks
hadn't showed up when he did I would have
knocked a little freshness out of him."</p>

<p>"He wasn't as fresh as you were," broke in
little Willie Patterson. "He asked a civil question
and you began to be funny before any of
us had time to answer. And, besides, it mightn't
have been so easy to knock what you say is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
'freshness' out of him. I notice he didn't back up
much when you rushed him. Was the suit case
heavy?" he added mockingly. Willie's diminutive
size made him bold, and, besides, wasn't his
sturdy but slow-witted room-mate, A. B. C.
Sinclair, commonly called Alphabet, there to fight
his battles for him in case his sharp tongue ran
him into difficulties?</p>

<p>Dixon knew he was at a disadvantage, shut
his jaws tight and said nothing, but if his look
meant anything it meant that a heavy hand was
to fall on Frank at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>"That's the fellow the papers have been talking
about. Call him the 'great swimmer boy of
Milton' because he got in a race with the champion
Darnell down in Florida somewhere,"
sneered one of Chip's cronies, anxious to find
favor in the eyes of his boss.</p>

<p>"Swimmer! My eye," grunted Chip. "I could
tie one hand behind me and beat him out." Chip
boasted of being something of a swimmer himself,
and he could not believe that the slender
boy, whom he had tried to jolly and later to
scare, had the strength to swim against him.
"If I get him in the water some time I'll drown
him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Willie. "I
think he's all right, and I'm going up to his
room and tell him we are not all grouches like
you are," and picking himself up he steered
rapidly for Warren Hall to square matters with
his own conscience. The bearing of the new boy
had won him completely.</p>

<p>Without a hint of the storm of injured feelings
left behind, and consequently unheeding, Mr.
Parks walked rapidly with Frank across the
school quadrangle to Warren, and shortly arrived
at the quaint old doorway of the second entry.</p>

<p>"Warren was the first of the buildings of
Queen's," said Mr. Parks as they trudged along.
"It used to be the whole school when there were
only about twenty-five boys. That was fifty
years ago, but as the number of pupils increased
these other buildings were added, and we have
room now for a hundred and eighty boys altogether."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know the school has been growing.
Father says it's the best in the state."</p>

<p>"Well, I think there are none better, even
though our friends of the Warwick school up
the river put on airs occasionally," said Mr.
Parks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's Russell Hall across the north end of
the yard where the recitation rooms are," he
continued, "and the school library and the social
hall; and at the north end of Warren there, is
the chapel. Just across from Warren is Honeywell
where the school officers are. Doctor
Hobart, the head of the school&mdash;you know him,
of course&mdash;has his quarters in Warren. So you'll
have to be on your best behavior." And Parks
smiled down on the lad to whom he was much
attracted.</p>

<p>They were now at the foot of the entry where
was located No. 18. Mr. Parks plunged up the
stairs and Frank followed at his heels, taking
time to note the queer old crooked stairway, the
newel post which was nothing more than a round
block of wood carved with many initials, and
the hand rail scarred with many a knife line
where the ambitious initial cutters had dug deep
to impress their fame on succeeding generations.
The painted plaster of one side of the stairway
was scrawled with initials, impromptu verses and
rude sketches, caricatures evidently of school
characters.</p>

<p>"Here we are," said Frank's guide, stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
before a door on the second landing. "Let's see
if Gleason's in," and he tapped lightly. There
was no response, and turning the knob he stepped
within. Frank followed at his heels, and entered
what was to be his new home for a number of
months at least.</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't say Gleason was much of a
hand at keeping things tidy," observed Mr.
Parks. "Maybe you can help him. I wish you
luck. If I can assist in any way, just call on
me. I have an office in Russell Hall, ground
floor, first entry, and my office hours are printed
on a slip on the door. Come and see me when you
get settled. Good day."</p>

<p>"Good day, sir, and thank you for your kindness,"
replied Frank, and the door shut.</p>

<p>Parks was right when he said Gleason was
not a tidy housekeeper, for the place was in
heaped up disorder. Evidently Gleason had not
yet succeeded in settling himself. His clothes
were scattered around the room, and mateless
shoes bestrewed the floor. A laundry box lay
tipped on the window seat with half its contents
on the cushion and half on the floor, and the
center table was filled with a promiscuous assortment
of books, writing materials, a tennis racket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and several tennis balls reposing on a battered
flannel cap. Out of this crazy jumble on the
table, the drop light rose like a mushroom-topped
lighthouse. The fine fireplace was piled full of
crumpled papers.</p>

<p>Frank's own things had been tumbled into his
bedroom, and there lay his first work of straightening
things out. He was busily engaged in setting
things in order when there came a tap on
the outer door, and following the tap, without
waiting on ceremony, a hand pushed it open.
Frank turned and saw his visitor, noticing at
once that it was one of the group he had encountered
a little while before.</p>

<p>"You're Frank Armstrong," said the newcomer.</p>

<p>"That's my name."</p>

<p>"Well, my name's Patterson, Wee Willie they
call me because I'm so big." The manner was
friendly and genial.</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "Glad to see you," he said as
Wee Willie stuck out his hand.</p>

<p>The visitor continued: "I happened to be in
that bunch of fellows this afternoon, and I came
up to apologize for Queen's, and to tell you that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Chip Dixon made me sick. He didn't speak for
the school when he cut into you this afternoon
so heavy."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He's in my class, a Junior, and belongs to the
society that thinks it runs this school, but he's a
big bluff, if anyone should ask you about it.
He's got most of us scared to death because he's
so handy with his tongue and his fist, but it
tickled me to death to see you stand up to him this
afternoon. Christopher is his name, but 'Chip'
is a nickname they've given him."</p>

<p>"I couldn't do anything else, could I?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not, but it is going to put you
in bad with Gamma Tau all right. They are awfully
clannish."</p>

<p>"Do you belong?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"No, they didn't think enough of me to give me
a bid, but I don't care. I don't like the bunch
they took from our class, and I would rather be
outside looking in, than inside looking out.
Gamma Tau used to be looked up to, but lately
they have stopped giving the election for merit.
It's all politics now, and the master, old Pop
Eye Hobart, said he would abolish it if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
didn't stop their monkeying and get down to first
principles."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure I don't care whether I get an
election or not, if it's that kind of a society. I'd
rather stay out."</p>

<p>"The trouble is that the society runs the athletics
of this school," continued the diminutive
oracle, "and it's a hard job to make any team if
you don't have the Gamma Tau pin. If you do
have it, no matter how rank you may be, you're
IT with a large capital I."</p>

<p>"Then that's what's the matter with your teams
up here, is it?" queried Frank, who had kept an
eye on Queen's school athletics for some time,
and knew that victories were rarities.</p>

<p>"Hit it first time, right in the eye. We are
punky to the state of rottenness, and we'll remain
that way till the Gamma gets its head
knocked off, and the best athletes in the school
get a chance. As it is now, the best we have don't
try.</p>

<p>"Well, I must be off," said Wee Willie, as he
slid from the window seat. "I just wanted to
tell you we're not all like Chip Dixon. He's a
crab and walks backward and doesn't know it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Ta ta, see you later," and the Wee One swung
himself out of the door and clattered down the
stairs, leaving Frank to straighten out his effects
as best he might, and puzzle on the first tangle
of life at school in which he found himself.</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER II.</span><span class="subtit">AN AFTERNOON OF FOOTBALL.</span></h2>

<p>Frank had succeeded, after some hard work,
in getting order out of chaos, and was in the
act of unpacking his suit case when there was
a thundering clatter on the stairs, and Jimmy,
followed more leisurely by Lewis, broke into the
room without even the ceremony of knocking.</p>

<p>"Well, if it isn't my old eel from Seawall,"
shouted Jimmy boisterously. "We thought you
were never coming."</p>

<p>"You certainly took your time," said Lewis.
"You were only going to be a week late and here
half the month is gone and half the football
schedule's been played. Give an account of yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, they weren't prepared to have
me go till the winter term, and it takes father
a long time to change his mind after he gets it
made up to one thing. But mother and I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
at him and proved to him that I was as fit as a
race horse and there would be no more breaking
down. So here I am."</p>

<p>"And about time, too. You're going out for
the football team, I suppose," said Jimmy. "You
see the school isn't a very big one, and everyone
who is heavy enough takes a try at it. Even
Lewis here is on the squad."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," nodded Lewis from the window
seat. "I didn't intend to try for it, but the captain
sent over one day and said it wouldn't be
fair to the school if I hid all my talent under
a bushel."</p>

<p>"Yes, and it's been hid under a sweater ever
since. Lewis is a fine ornament to any sideline,"
said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Are you on the team, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"O, no. I'm just on the squad doing what
they tell me to. I got a chance yesterday afternoon
to play tackle, but I'm about as much at
home playing up in the line as a tadpole in a
haymow. The tackle opposite me played horse
with me. And the coach glared at me savagely
whenever the play went over me, and that was
every time, I guess."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn't he know you were a back?" asked
Frank.</p>

<p>"I ventured to tell him that, but he told me in
the most courteous fashion to shut up, and I
shut."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you have a chance?"</p>

<p>"About as much chance as I have to be president,
which, considering that there are somewhere
about ten million possible candidates, is
a problem that even Lewis could figure."</p>

<p>"Jimmy hasn't got a chance to make the team,
Frank. I haven't been here but three weeks, and
it's as plain as the nose on your face that if
you haven't a Gamma pin on you, you might as
well go way back and be comfortably seated.
Tom Harding, the captain, is a Gamma, the
manager is a Gamma, and I know for a fact
that ten out of the eleven are in the same society."</p>

<p>"It's a regular open and shut game," added
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Isn't there another society here?" inquired
Frank. "What's the matter with it?"</p>

<p>"Alpha Beta. It doesn't count," said Lewis
contemptuously. "Gamma Tau is the oldest society,
and has had things all its own way for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
some years. Then some of the fellows, about six
years ago, got together and ran in Alpha Beta,
and for a little while it made a good fight against
its older rival. But as every one was trying
for the Gamma, the Alpha got the second run of
fellows until now it isn't an honor to belong to
it, and the fellows who don't get Gamma turn
the other down flat, preferring to have nothing."</p>

<p>"Seems like a chance for a third," observed
Frank. "Wonder it hasn't been started."</p>

<p>"No one has the nerve to start it," said Lewis.
"They growl and growl at the Gamma like nice
little dogs, but they never bite."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz, it's nearly practice time," cried
Jimmy. "We go out from four to five every day,
and we've just time to make it. Stop your prinking,
and come along. You can sit on the bleachers
and see football as she is played by Lewis and
me."</p>

<p>Frank, nothing loth, banged shut the suit case,
and putting on his cap was soon scampering with
the two friends toward the playground.</p>

<p>Queen's school playground was the gift of a
wealthy graduate of the school who had kept his
interest in the old place. Its equipment was most
complete. The playground lay to the west of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
line of school buildings,&mdash;gridiron, diamond, and
boat-house, and beyond the latter the tennis courts,
all models in themselves, and ample in size for
the needs of the school for many years to come.</p>

<p>Nature had done her share in the first place
with a tract of land almost as level as a floor and
some thirty acres in extent, but the hand of man
completed the job, and the playground was one
of the show places of Queen's School. Its rather
low level, as it bordered on the Wampaug river,
insured a greenness of verdure no matter how
dry the season. Trained ground keepers kept
the place like a gentleman's garden. Stands
which would accommodate several thousand
people were ranged on both sides of the gridiron,
and a much smaller but prettily covered
stand gave ample room for spectators at the
diamond. The boat-house was well furnished
with canoes, pair oars and gigs, and even boasted
a fine cedar eight-oared shell and a heavier eight
called a barge. But Queen's rowing had declined
in late years, and it had been some time since
the shell held a victorious crew. Around the
gridiron was the running track, a pretty and well
kept cinder path on which the track meets of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
school were held, and where every other year
Queen's met Warwick in their annual struggle.</p>

<p>"Isn't she a beauty?" cried Jimmy, waving his
hand with a proprietor's sense of ownership over
the whole fair prospect, as the boys reached the
crest of the little hill behind Warren Hall. The
whole of the playground dotted with exercising
boys lay open to their view.</p>

<p>It surely was a beauty; and Frank felt his
heart swell with pride in the knowledge that he
was now a part of it. What worlds there were
to conquer here! Would he be able to win his
place in these fields?</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," he whispered to himself.</p>

<p>"This is the gymnasium," said Lewis, pointing
to a low structure between the gridiron and the
diamond. "Let's make tracks. There's the coach
now. You go right over to the bleachers, and
we'll be dressed on the field in a few minutes.
Practice will begin very soon."</p>

<p>They parted, and Frank went on alone.
When he reached his seat, a score of fellows,
who had dressed early, were tumbling around
on the ground like so many kittens, falling on the
ball which was being tossed to them by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
coach, big Harry Horton, who at the same time
belabored them with words.</p>

<p>"Fenton, you fall on that ball like a hippopotamus;
what are you doing, playing leap-frog?
That's not the way. Dive for it, and gather it
in to you. Try again." Fenton tried again, but
with no better success.</p>

<p>"Look,&mdash;this way!" And Horton rolled the
ball along the ground, sprang after it like a cat,
turning slightly sideways in the air, making a
little pocket between knees and arms as he flew.
When he fetched up, the ball was snugly tucked
close to his body in a position which would make
it perfectly safe from any attempts by fair or
foul tactics.</p>

<p>Fenton was impressed and made another try,
doing it a little better.</p>

<p>"Good, now, MacIntosh, make it sure. When
you go for the ball don't go in such a great
hurry. When you're in so big a hurry you don't
know what you're doing; make it safe. Keep
your head, even when you leave your feet."
Horton had been a great player in his day on one
of the big college teams, and had taken up the
work of athletic director temporarily at Queen's,
where he was greatly liked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The squad was augmented by fifteen or twenty
boys as this preliminary instruction was going
on, and practice now began in earnest. Among
those in the field, Jimmy took his place. Frank
could see that he was skillful at falling on the
ball, and that he handled himself like a cat. As
he was laughing at some of the attempts of
Lewis to corral the rolling ball, a voice alongside
cried:</p>

<p>"Hello, Armstrong, why aren't you in the
fray?" and turning, Frank saw approaching him
Wee Willie Patterson.</p>

<p>"Don't mind if I sit down with you?" said the
Wee One cordially.</p>

<p>"Mighty glad if you want to," returned Frank,
who had taken a great liking to the diminutive
but independent Patterson. "It was lonesome
here alone."</p>

<p>"There's your friend of this afternoon, Mr.
Chip Dixon, talking with Captain Harding. He's
quarterback of the eleven, and a mighty good
one at that. He can play the game if he can't
do anything else. He pretty near runs the team,
too, for Harding is not much more than a figurehead,
even though he is a Senior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"There she goes now. We're going to have
a line-up, and a bit of a scrimmage, I guess."</p>

<p>"First and Second elevens," cried Horton from
the field, and as they took their positions,&mdash;"now
make this good. We are only going to have
fifteen minutes of it. Second team's ball for
the kick-off." Jimmy was not in either line-up,
Frank noticed with regret, but thought that
maybe he'd get in before the end.</p>

<p>"Bing." Away shot the ball from midfield
driven by the sturdy toe of Duncan McLeod's
foot. It settled in the arms of the First eleven's
fullback, twenty-five yards down the field, and
that individual came ripping back, tossing the
Second's players over like nine-pins, until he had
brought the ball back to midfield.</p>

<p>"Peaches, peaches," cried the spectators.</p>

<p>"Line-up, quick," yelled the coach who was
acting as coach and referee as well. "You would
have gone clear through," he said to the fullback,
slapping him on the back as he dodged
through behind to take his position at the other
end of the line, "if you had used your arm as
I told you. Remember it next time."</p>

<p>"Come, now, make it go," barked Dixon, "1&mdash;7&mdash;33."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a quick pass, and Hillard, the left
half, had the ball, and with a good interference shot
for the right end of the Second's line. The defensive
tackle was nicely put out of the play, and
the right half cut across and took care of the
waiting end. Hillard was quickly past the line
and bearing off well to out-distance the defensive
half.</p>

<p>"Look at the fool," yelled Wee Willie, "he
has left his interference behind him. Morton
will nip him. What did I tell you! O, rot, look
at that!" Hillard had indeed left his interference,
disobeying orders, but he thought he
was fast and agile enough to clear the quarterback
of the Second team, who was waiting his
coming on the 20-yard line, inching over toward
the side lines so that the runner would have less
ground in which to dodge.</p>

<p>In spite of his plan and his speed, Hillard could
not avoid those eager arms of the quarter, and
down he went in a whirling tackle. The ball
flew from his grasp as he struck the ground,
then it bounced crazily around, and finally nestled
itself in the arms of Tompkins, the Second's left
half who had come across to strengthen his quarter's
defense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Tompkins, seeing his opportunity, was away
to the side of the field from which the play had
come like the wind, every man Jack of the First
eleven having been carried in the direction of
Hillard. Before they could bring themselves to
a halt, and turn on their tracks, Tompkins had
gathered speed. Once a tackle got a hand on him,
but he shook it off, and with a clear field carried
the ball across the goal line, touched it down
behind the posts, and sat there upon it, grinning
like a Cheshire cat.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER III.</span><span class="subtit">JIMMY GETS IN THE GAME.</span></h2>


<p>"Now, they'll get it for fair," observed the Wee
One as the coach went striding down the field,
following the scattered members of the First
eleven who jogged sulkily down to the goal; and
get it they did.</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed of you, Hillard," burst out Horton.
"You've been playing two years on this
team, and you can't hang onto a ball yet. If
any one crosses his fingers in front of you, you
lose the ball. Go and sit down." Hillard turned
and walked slowly toward the side of the field,
with head hanging. He was a good back, but had
the fatal habit of fumbling. He was so clever
at dodging and so fast on his feet, however, that
the coach, knowing well his failing, was still
tempted to put him in the line-up,&mdash;and, besides,
he belonged to the powerful Gamma Tau.</p>

<p>"Tucker, you take Hillard's place, and see if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
we can't do something. Here we are, only three
weeks from our last game, and you are playing
like a perfectly lovely eleven from the Mount
Hope Female Seminary. Think a little about
the game, and squeeze that ball, PLEASE."</p>

<p>The coach took the ball from Tompkins, and
started up the field, the whole crowd of players
straggling along behind him, the First eleven
sour in face and heavy in step, the Second grinning
broadly.</p>

<p>"There, now," said Horton, putting the ball
down at midfield again with a good deal more
force than was necessary. "Let's have some football.
First eleven's ball. Make it go. You've
got to carry it from here, don't kick it, carry
it. Make it go," and he jumped out of the way
as the two lines crashed together.</p>

<p>"That's something like it. Second down, two
yards to go. Some more like that."</p>

<p>"Big Dutton carried it that time," said Patterson
to Frank. "That big fellow with the light
hair. He's the best plunger on the field, but he's
something of a bonehead, and he can't remember
the signals. Poor Horton has his own worries
with him. There he goes again."</p>

<p>"First down," yelled Horton from the field.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
"That's going. Squeeze that ball, Dutton.
Steady in the line there and keep on side. Wait
till the ball is snapped, Burnham. Wait till the
ball is snapped&mdash;there, what did I tell you?" as
Burnham, the right tackle, anticipating the signal,
plunged ahead. Little Hopkinson, quarter
of the Second, had his hand up and was yelling
for the penalty, which he got.</p>

<p>"Now, First team, you've got to make that loss
up this time." Harding, the captain, stepped out
of his place at guard, in the line, and conferred
with Dixon a minute.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a long pass, I'll bet dollars
to shoelaces," said the Wee One, as the lines
settled down on their toes.</p>

<p>"22&mdash;16&mdash;34&mdash;146," shouted Dixon. There
was a quick pass from center, and the quarter,
turning half-way round, tucked the ball cleverly
in the right half's pocketed arms as he went
shooting past him. The half ran straight out,
seemingly bent on turning in at the first possible
moment. But this little ruse was only to draw
the fire of the opponents who came charging at
him. Then he stopped dead in his tracks, stepped
backwards and threw the ball unerringly to the
right end who had edged away out toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
side line at the proper time, entirely unnoticed by
the Second backs who had been drawn over.
The catch was clearly made, by Campbell, and he
was away like a breeze, with no one near him.
Hopkinson came up on him hard, a little too
hard for safety, and he was easily sidestepped
by the fleet-footed end who, though hard pressed,
eluded all tackles and carried the ball over. It
was a pretty piece of work, and the coach, for
once, seemed to be satisfied.</p>

<p>"Now, that's what I call pretty football," exclaimed
Frank. "I thought you said this team
was no good."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't," replied Patterson. "Once in
a while they can pull a play like that off, but
most of the time they make a grand fizzle out of
it. They don't seem to have the spirit, somehow.
I'll bet they'll flub-dub it yet."</p>

<p>"Good work, good work," said the coach as
he took the ball again. "No time for goal-kicking
now. First, see what you can do in
carrying it through the line. What's the matter,
Harper?"</p>

<p>This last remark was directed at the right half
on the Second team, who was limping around,
having got in the way of one of the First's linemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and received a bad tumble in open field
while chasing Campbell.</p>

<p>"My old ankle," replied Harper, walking
around and wincing every time he touched his
foot to the ground. "The one I hurt last week."</p>

<p>"Go and sit down. I'll attend to it after practice;
loosen your shoe if it hurts. I want someone
to take Harper's place," continued Horton,
glancing up and down the row of boys sitting on
the sideline. "Hey, you Freshman, what's-your-name,"
indicating Turner, "get in and play this
half."</p>

<p>"Who is that going in?" inquired the Wee One,
as Jimmy jumped up and ran onto the field.
"Looks like a likely kid."</p>

<p>"He's a friend of mine, Jimmy Turner; he's a
Freshman."</p>

<p>"He looks as strong as a bull. Does he know
the game?"</p>

<p>"No, not very well, but he's crazy about it,
and I'll bet he makes good."</p>

<p>Jimmy took his position, and the next instant
he was on the bottom of a pile of bodies and
arms and legs. Big Dutton had come through
the line, and Jimmy met him with all his force,
and stopped him. But there had been a gain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Again Dutton came ramming through. This
time the guard and tackle had opened a hole in
the Second's line five feet wide, and Dutton had
time to get up some speed before he reached
Jimmy, who waited for him. It was a bigger gain
this time.</p>

<p>"Come on," yelled the coach, dashing around
from behind the attacking eleven. "This Second
line isn't doing its work at all. Here you,"
indicating Jimmy, "don't wait for that back to
come through on you, play up to the line, you've
got to throw him back. Now again!"</p>

<p>This time the play slammed through the opposite
side of the line for three yards to a first
down.</p>

<p>"That's more like it now," encouraged Horton.
"Show this school that you are good for something.
Come on, a few more will take it across!"</p>

<p>This time Dixon sent his catapult at Jimmy's
territory. But although the line opened wide
enough to admit two like Dutton, Jimmy was in
the breach. He sprang hard and low, and carried
Dutton's legs right out from under him.
It is needless to say that the ball stopped right
there.</p>

<p>"Second down, four to go," called out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
coach, not before he had ducked around behind
Jimmy and hit him a slap on the back, at the
same time giving him an encouraging "Good
work, Freshman."</p>

<p>Having respect for the strength of that side
of the secondary defense, the play was directed
at the other side of center, and when the pile
was untangled, the ball lay only a yard from
first down, and less than two yards from the
goal line.</p>

<p>"Now," yelled Chip Dixon, "we have 'em
where we want 'em. Make it go and hang onto
the ball, 22&mdash;36&mdash;19&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's coming through center," yelled little Hopkinson,
"back-up, center&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Change signals," shouted Chip, and then began
to reel off a signal which he meant to have
the effect of spreading out the defense, but the
acute quarter, now playing close in, whispered
to his backs: "It's a fake, it's a fake, the play's
coming through center. Look out, look out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And through center it came with a vengeance,
Dutton carrying the ball, crashing and grinding
past the guard and tackle who had not been deceived
by the trick of changing signals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keep your feet, keep your feet," yelled Horton,
dancing around near the end of the line.</p>

<p>Just when it looked like a certainty that Dutton
had cleared the line, the two backs of the Second
team, reinforced by the ends who had come
around to help, threw themselves at the big back.
Jimmy was underneath, and the big fellow came
crashing to the ground; with a twist and a wriggling
half turn he struck hard right across the
goal line, and the ball popped from beneath his
arm into plain view. In an instant there was
a scramble, everyone within distance diving for
the sphere without regard to danger of broken
heads.</p>

<p>"The First has scored," said Frank. "Jimmy
couldn't stop him, I guess."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said the Wee One.
"Depends on who has that ball. It's the First's&mdash;no,
it isn't," as the coach began to dig down
among the tangle of arms and legs and heads.
"No, it's the Second's, it is, by gravy." For when
Horton had finally succeeded in getting to the
bottom of the heap, there lay Jimmy just across
the goal line, and underneath him, tucked up securely
between his arms and his chin, was the
ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>How Jimmy had recovered the ball, no one
knew, but there it was; and Jimmy himself wasn't
able to tell if he had been asked, for when the
pile was untangled Jimmy lay still. Horton
slapped him on the back. "There, that's enough,
let go of it now; great work, Freshman&mdash;&mdash;"
but there was no response, and then Horton
turned him over on his back.</p>

<p>"Get the water bottle, quick," he cried. "This
youngster's knocked out." In a moment they
stretched Jimmy on the ground, opened his jacket
and bathed his face with the water which had
been hurriedly brought from the sidelines. A
thin trickle of blood ran down from his matted
hair, just above his forehead.</p>

<p>"Send for Patsy, the trainer, quick," commanded
Horton, and some lively sprinting followed
to the other end of the field where that
individual was working over the twisted ankle
of Harper.</p>

<p>Patsy Duffy came in hot haste, with his handbag
of bandages, but by the time he had arrived
on the scene, Jimmy opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"He's coming to all right. By Jove, Freshman,
it was a fine piece of work," said Horton,
as he gently nursed the head of the injured boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
"You'll be all right in a minute. If I had ten
more like you we'd have a football team. There,
can you walk?" he asked, as Jimmy struggled to
his feet and started dizzily.</p>

<p>When he saw that Jimmy had been hurt, Frank
sprang from the stand and came down the field,
and now, eager to help, he slipped his arm under
that of Jimmy, and with one of the players helped
to steady him as he walked around. Duffy had
already put a bandage around Jimmy's head to
stop the flow of blood.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," said Jimmy. "Don't bother
yourself about me. Someone bumped me over
the eye with his knee, I think."</p>

<p>"That's all for to-day," said the coach. "I've
got a word to say to you at the gymnasium," and
he led the way in that direction, the players trooping
after him in silence.</p>

<p>"Sorry he didn't break his blooming neck,"
muttered Chip to Harding as they trailed along.
"I see he is a friend of that young Armstrong's."</p>

<p>"This probably means," said Harding, "that
Horton will want to have Turner play one of the
backs of the First team."</p>

<p>"I'll fix that all right. I'll make Turner look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
like the father of all the fumblers if Horton
puts him behind the line with me."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind, but just watch out. Hillard
and Dutton are both in our crowd, and we
don't want any Freshman muts on the team. But
don't you worry, there won't be any. I have my
own plan, and the less you know about it, the
better, for you're the captain, and you don't want
to be accused more than you can help of playing
favorites. Let me take care of it, and I'll
show you how to put this young Turner in the
shade."</p>

<p>By this time the gymnasium had been reached.
Horton stood just inside the door to the main
dressing room, and when the last straggler had
entered, he shut the door and turned around to
face his pupils of the gridiron.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you, young gentlemen," he said
in a very quiet voice, "that if you continue to
play football as you are playing it now, I might
as well quit the job. You haven't improved since
that disgraceful defeat by the Milton High
School three weeks ago. The material is here
but you haven't as much spirit as a sick cat. You
do not get together. Once in a while you show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
what you could do if you would get together. No
team can get together and do anything unless it
is a team, every one helping every one else, doing
his own work and giving the other fellow a
hand when he needs it. If you don't get this
spirit, Warwick will show you up worse than they
did a year ago. You know very well what the
trouble is," (he referred to the Society domination
of football interests), "and you know the
remedy. Captain Harding, you've got to play
the best men on your squad. I'm going to have
a long practice to-morrow, and I want you all
to report at 4 o'clock sharp. That's all, good
day," and Horton turned on his heel and left the
gymnasium.</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER IV.</span><span class="subtit">FRANK HAS A NEW NAME.</span></h2>

<p>It was a gloomy lot of football players that
took their shower that night. They dressed in
silence. Horton was by no means a mild-spoken
coach, yet his method was to get the best out
of the players by persuasion and infinite care.
But when he occasionally did open up, the words
were all the sharper.</p>

<p>"Laid the hot shot into you fellows, didn't he?"
said Patterson, sliding up to his classmate, Dixon,
as they climbed the slope to the dormitories.</p>

<p>"Yes, Horton has had a grouch for the last
two weeks and we can't please him. Better come
out and try it yourself."</p>

<p>"You'd please him if you played the game,"
retorted the Wee One, who never lost a chance
of sticking verbal pins into the quarterback. "I
noticed a new back to-day, that young Turner
fellow. He has Hillard beaten twenty ways for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Sunday," he added. "Wouldn't be surprised if
he made the team even at this late date."</p>

<p>"I didn't see him do anything wonderful,"
growled Chip. "Dutton went through him several
times. I'll bet he'll be sore to-morrow where
those old keen bones of the big fellow hit him.
He's new and he probably put all he had into
the practice to-day. To-morrow he'll be like
putty."</p>

<p>"If I was a betting man," retorted the Wee
One, "I'd lay you some good coin on it. He
doesn't know much about it, but he has the stuff
in him, and Horton will do the rest. I think he
will play in the Warwick game, Chip."</p>

<p>"And I say he won't," burst out Chip savagely.
"Hillard is worth two of him," and then seeing a
sarcastic grin playing on the features of Patterson,
he added, "I'll see that he don't play&mdash;&mdash;"
and then he stopped short, fearing he had said
too much.</p>

<p>"O, is that so, Mr. Dixon, and when did they
elect you captain and coach of this daisy eleven
of ours?"</p>

<p>"O, dry up," was all the comment he could get
from Chip who, having reached the yard by this
time, turned abruptly and left his tormentor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy, Frank and Lewis were a few rods behind,
and the Wee One waited for them to come
up. Frank had just been detailing the story of
his arrival at the yard that afternoon and Dixon's
exhibition of bad temper. Both Jimmy and Lewis
were indignant, but Frank laughed about the incident.
"It wasn't worth mentioning," he said,
"but it shows you what kind of a chap your
quarter is."</p>

<p>"I've been here only three weeks," said Jimmy,
"and I've heard lots of things about him being
a bully, particularly fond of playing on the
smaller fellow. I guess he can't do much to me.
I'm only a Freshman, but I'll give him a dig in
the ribs if he tries any of his tricks on me."</p>

<p>The Wee One was waiting on the flagged walk
in front of Warren Hall as the three boys came
along.</p>

<p>"We'll be over in a minute and take you to
grub," Jimmy was saying to Frank.</p>

<p>"All right," said Frank, "I'll be waiting for you
and getting things in such shape that I can comfortably
rest myself to-night. My room-mate
Gleason's a fearful and wonderful housekeeper,
judging from the looks of his effects up to date,"
and he turned into his entry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, Armstrong, just a minute." Frank stopped
and saw his new sophomore friend approaching
at a leisurely roll with his hands shoved deep
into his trousers' pockets.</p>

<p>"I say," volunteered the Wee One, "that young
friend of yours, Turner, looks pretty good to
me. But I want to give you a tip. If he plays
that way he's sure to get a chance at the team.
But for the good of the cause I'm just dropping
you a weenty teenty hint. Tell him to keep his
weather eye on Chip Dixon."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Frank, showing his surprise very
plainly.</p>

<p>"Well, Chip doesn't want him and he'd take any
means, fair or unfair, to put him in bad with
the coach. It's just a tip from an old fellow.
That's all," and the Wee One, having delivered
himself of this advice, went whistling on his way.</p>

<p>"I don't see what Chip can do if Jimmy plays
well enough to make the team. I can't see what
Chip can do to keep him off," murmured Frank
to himself as he trudged up the stairs. "But I'll
pass along the friendly word of Little Willie,
who seems to be a fine little chap and much bigger
than his name."</p>

<p>Gleason was in his room this time, curled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
on the window cushion, and he slowly unrolled
himself as Frank pushed open the door.</p>

<p>"Hello, Armstrong," he said, "you're my wife,
I guess."</p>

<p>"Your what?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"My wife, my better half, my tried and trusty
room-mate, for better or for worser."</p>

<p>"I'm all of that," said Frank, smiling in spite
of himself at the voluble Gleason who wasn't the
sort of chap he had pictured at all. From the
tumbled state of the room, he had drawn his conclusion
that Gleason would also be in a tumbled
state, but here was an immaculate dandy.</p>

<p>Frank looked his room-mate over, and then his
gaze involuntarily traveled around the room.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Gleason grinning, "doesn't
look right," as he saw that Frank was trying to
adjust his notions anew. "You see I haven't time
to keep both of us tidy, the room and me, so I
put the time on myself and let the room go. I
was never made for a housekeeper."</p>

<p>Gleason was very tall and very thin, and had
thin, dark hair which he parted in the middle and
combed straight back. His collar was of the
white wings variety, very high, and encircled a
long, lean neck, and his necktie was of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
positive and overpowering lavender. Patent
leather pumps and socks to match his cravat, and
a suit with a decidedly purple cast to it, completed
his attire. Gleason had the appearance of
being half divinity student, half gambler, and
"the other half," as the Irishman said, "dude."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you like me, wifey?" asked Gleason
quizzically, as Frank stood just inside the
threshold eyeing this strange mixture of a boy.
"Sorry if you don't, for it's going to be no end
of a trouble. They're chock-a-block with flowering
youth at this blessed institution, and if we
fight one of us'll have to go into the cellar."</p>

<p>"O, we're going to get on all right," said Frank
grinning, "but you're so different from what I
had expected."</p>

<p>"Well, I might be worse. What are you going
in for?"</p>

<p>"It will be study for a while for mine. I'm
three weeks late. I'm too light for football this
year, and I don't know much about it, but I'm
going out for baseball in the spring. And maybe
I will get a chance at the track meets. I can run
a little. What do you go in for?"</p>

<p>"Me? O, I just sit round on the bleachers
and take notes. I soak myself in records and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
they just ooze out of all my pores. Very
handy young person to have around, Frank.
Don't mind my familiarity, that's your handle&mdash;I
saw it on your boxes. Good name for the family
Bible, but kind of cold for school life. Haven't
you got something warmer? They call me 'Codfish'
because, forsooth, I came from up Cape
Cod way. But the cod is a good fish properly
treated, so I don't object. Haven't you something
in the way of a name besides your Christian
ticket?"</p>

<p>"No, just Frank."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't right. It isn't cosey and homey
enough. All right for the school catalogue, but
too chilly for everyday use. What's your
'ponchong' as the French say, your big swipe, in
other words?"</p>

<p>"Well, I do a little swimming now and then,"
said Frank. "How would Fish be?"</p>

<p>"Won't do. Can't have two members of the
ichthyosaurus family in one room. Let's see.
Eel&mdash;no, eel isn't good, he spends most of his
time in the mud. Duck&mdash;no, the young ladies at
the seminary'd be calling you ducky some day.
I have it&mdash;web-foot, Web-foot Armstrong, how's
that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sounds all right," said Frank, "kind of a
paddler, eh?"</p>

<p>"An inspiration, my boy. Web-foot is your
name from henceforth, to have and to hold until
death do you part&mdash;Web-foot Armstrong, thus
I christen thee."</p>

<p>A sound was heard on the stairs, and in another
moment Jimmy and Lewis appeared at
the open doorway. They were already acquainted
with Gleason, and nodded to him.</p>

<p>"Welcome to our city," cried Gleason coming
forward. "Are you acquainted with my young
friend, Web-foot Armstrong? He is my steady
for whom I've been waiting for three long weeks."</p>

<p>"It's a new name my room-mate has given me,"
explained Frank laughing. "He says Frank isn't
homey enough."</p>

<p>"Web-foot suits him all right. He's a perfect
water-dog, you know," said Jimmy. "One of the
rising young swimmers of the generation and all
that sort of thing; gave the champion a hard rub
down in Florida."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said the Codfish, straddling. "I
saw something about that; let's see, I have it
somewhere&mdash;yes, here it is," as he began picking
in a big envelope among a number of clippings&mdash;"here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
it is&mdash;'Champion Boy Swimmer of Milton
hustles the Champion,' copied from the <em>St. Augustine
Record</em>," and he began to read an exaggerated
account of the affair in the Florida tank.</p>

<p>"That was going some," he concluded. "Darnell's
record is 56 and 2-5 seconds for the hundred.
He did that at the Olympics in Athens two
years ago and repeated it in the New York Athletic
Club last winter."</p>

<p>The Codfish reeled off the information with the
certainty of knowledge.</p>

<p>"He knows every amateur record that was
ever made, I think," Jimmy whispered to Frank,
"and can tell you what the score of every league
contest was since he was big enough to fall out
of the cradle; and he is a great practical joker, so
they say. You want to look out for his tricks."</p>

<p>"Stop filling us up on your records, Gleason,"
said Lewis. "I'm hungry as a bear. Let's fill
up on something more substantial."</p>

<p>The boys raced down the stairs with a clatter
and headed in the direction of Howard Hall beyond
Russell. Howard was the old gymnasium
which had been turned into a great dining hall,
and there, amid the crash of crockery, Frank sat
down to his first school meal, flanked by Jimmy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and Lewis. Across the table was the irrepressible
Codfish.</p>

<p>"We all mess together here, you see," said
Jimmy, waving his hand abroad, "but the upper
classes have that end of the hall to themselves.
Noisy, isn't it, but you'll get used to it."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. He was taking in this part of
his new life, with all his eyes and ears to the exclusion
of his stomach. What would his mother
think of this rumpus, he thought, and he smiled
to himself.</p>

<p>"Hey, Skip, you there, don't hog all the butter,
shoot it down here," called the Codfish.
"You use as much grease as a six-cylinder transmission."
And the butter dish came hurtling
down from Skip Congdon, caroming against the
pepper and salt dishes and knocking them off
their pins.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>


<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER V.</span><span class="subtit">CAPTURED BY THE ENEMY.</span></h2>

<p>The meal was finally over. There was nothing
of the home quiet in it at all. The Codfish well
described it as "grab and guzzle and git."</p>

<p>Outside the early dusk had come and the lights
of the dormitories twinkled out here and there
to meet the moon which had just pushed her disk
above the cloudless eastern horizon. The katydids
kept up their ceaseless argument in the great
elms overhead as Frank and Jimmy walked slowly
arm in arm down the yard. Lewis had dashed
off to his room to do some long over-due work on
a recitation for the early morning hour.</p>

<p>From the other side of the yard came the sound
of singing.</p>

<p>"That's the Glee Club tuning up," said Jimmy.
"They sing out of doors until it gets too cold to
be comfortable."</p>

<p>The song floated over to them beneath the
dusky arbor of the elm trees:</p>

<p>The boys came to a halt as they listened to
the rollicking melody borne to their ears on the
evening breeze. To Frank came the exquisite
feeling of being a part of the school, and the song
thrilled him out of all relation to its value as
music.</p>

<p>"Great, isn't it?" and he looked up at the dark,
gently swaying branches overhead and let his
eye follow the long line of school buildings. "I
was wondering only a little while ago," he said,
"if it wouldn't be the best thing for me to go to
work somewhere and give up school and college."</p>

<p>"Changed your mind about it so soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess I have. It's fine to be a part
of a school like Queen's, and to meet all the
fellows, and fight your little battles, and maybe
win a few. I don't think I'll ever amount to
much here, but I'm going to have a try at everything
that comes my way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did your father and mother say about
your going to work?"</p>

<p>"O, mother didn't think much of it, but Dad,
as usual, put it up to me. 'It's your own life, you
know, and you've got to live it. If you want to
go into business life now, I'll find you a good
place to start, and if you want to take a few extra
years broadening your education, there's Queen's
ready to take you if you're ready for her.' And
I'm glad I decided this way. It's going to be
wonderful." He had forgotten the meeting with
Dixon that afternoon, and the unhappy incident
at his appearance on the scene. The black
shadow of Gamma Tau which had fallen across
his path did not trouble him.</p>

<p>Frank and Jimmy had traversed the length of
the school walk down to the great iron gates at
the Milton turnpike, and were returning up the
yard. The group on the steps of Russell were
still singing and were engaged at that particular
moment with the closing chords of a popular
tune. Then they broke out in a joyful and triumphant
pean, the new football song, written
by Arthur Stubbs, Jimmy informed Frank, "editor
of the <em>Mirror</em>, which maybe you don't know is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the great and buzzing school weekly. Sounds
pretty good, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>They both listened as the song rolled out on
the night air, doggerel sure enough, but given
life and character by the vigorous way it was
flung out:</p>

<p>"The last line is to be shouted in unison," explained
Jimmy, "and it will make a great noise
when the whole school gets into it."</p>

<p>The air was catchy, and Frank found himself
humming as he walked along:</p>

<p>"If I can't do anything else, Jimmy, I can help
the team by singing."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm thinking that singing won't save
this Queen's School football bunch when we meet
Warwick."</p>

<p>"Is Warwick strong this year? I saw they
had cleaned up Dean without much trouble, but
haven't noticed much about them."</p>

<p>"Strong!" ejaculated Jimmy, "I guess they are.
They've taken everyone they've played into camp
this fall, and they boast that Queen's scalp will
dangle at their belts as the last and the best of
the series. Like the fellow in Danny Deever,
'I'm dreading wot I got to watch' two weeks
from Saturday&mdash;that's the date of the bloody
battle down there on the gridiron," and Jimmy
jerked his thumb in the direction of the meadow.</p>

<p>In their promenade the boys had almost reached
the second entry in Warren Hall when they
noticed a group of perhaps half a dozen fellows,
a short distance up the walk. As Frank and
Jimmy came up to the entry this group got in
motion and approached them, and as they passed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
one of the group jostled Frank off the walk.
"Keep out of the way, Freshmen," said a gruff
voice, but in spite of the attempt to disguise it,
both boys recognized it instantly.</p>

<p>"Chip Dixon," they exclaimed in a breath.</p>

<p>"Now what is he hanging around here for with
that bunch of his cronies, I'd like to know," said
Jimmy. "I wonder if he has a notion of hazing
you. By Jove, I'll bet you a dollar that's it.
They were waiting for you to grab you, but seeing
me here they probably gave it up for the time
at least. Let's walk on."</p>

<p>"Why would they give it up? You talk like
a Senior, and if I haven't been sleeping like old
Rip Van, you're nothing more than a Freshman
yourself. My head isn't as hoary as yours by
three weeks, that's all."</p>

<p>"O, no, I've been through the mill and they
never haze a fellow twice. They gave me a jolly
roast though, and that let's me out for the rest
of my natural school life."</p>

<p>"What did they do to you?" inquired Frank,
who had heard of such doings on the persons of
unsuspecting and confiding youth. "I supposed
that hazing had been stopped here completely.
The <em>Milton Gazette</em> said that Doctor Hobart had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
ordered it stopped after they ducked that fellow
in the river one night and he got his death from
it."</p>

<p>"Yes; Dr. Hobart stopped hazing, and threatened
to fire anyone he caught at it, but while that
has stopped some of the worst of it maybe, it
isn't dead by a long shot. They didn't do much
to me, tied my hands and feet and rolled me
down the hill over there, and gave me an egg
shampoo and mussed me up considerable, but I
came out of it all right. Dixon was in the gang
that did for me, I think, but I'm not sure, because
they were masked."</p>

<p>"Well, they're not going to haze me," said
Frank, "if I see them first."</p>

<p>"Interference with your personal liberty resented,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, maybe. I wouldn't mind anybody but
Dixon, and I certainly will not have such a galoot
as he is mauling me around, if I have to fight
the whole gang."</p>

<p>"Better not fight, Frank. Better take it good
naturedly, and it will be over quick. If you resent,
you're likely to get it harder."</p>

<p>"Well, if they really are out to haze me there's
no help for it, but I'll have some fun, too," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
he stretched out his arm and flexed his muscles.
"Haven't been paddling canoes around the Florida
Everglades for nothing, Jimmy."</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned. "Better come up to my room
just the same; no use courting a ruction. If they
are after you, they may come around and not
finding you in, may give it up and forget about
it. Come on."</p>

<p>"Hanged if I do," said Frank. "I don't believe
there's anything to it. You, having had your
medicine, are suspicious. If they want me they
will find me."</p>

<p>By this time the two had retraced their steps
to Frank's entry. All was quiet. The singers
had ended their melodious efforts and moved off.
Only now and then a single figure could be seen
hurrying along under the tree arches. The moon,
rising higher in the sky, sent her beams through
the branches, and brought out every object in the
yard distinctly. No plotters against the peace
of No. 18 were to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>"False alarm, old man," said Frank, as they
stood there scanning the school yard. "All is
quiet on the Potomac. So long, see you in the
morning. Gleason must be visiting, for there's
no light in the room."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe you're right, but, just the same, turn
the key when you go into your room. So long,
see you in the morning."</p>

<p>"So long," echoed Frank, and turned and entered
the arching doorway.</p>

<p>Frank climbed the steps of the first flight three
at a leap. He wasn't afraid of Dixon and his
gang even if they were on the warpath. "It's
great to be back at school," he thought, and as
he took the last few steps leading to the second
landing, he hummed to himself the lines he had
heard the fellows singing:</p>


<div class="spaced poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Show them who's the master,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Raise the Blue and Gold."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>"What's the matter with this stairway,&mdash;no
light; they must be stingy with their gas," said
Frank aloud. "Since Gleason isn't back yet, I'll
have a session with these duds of mine and get my
room to rights. To-morrow I'll start on this sitting-room
ruin. Where did I put those blooming
matches?" he added to himself as he opened his
room door and stepped inside. "O, yes, I remember,
on the corner of the mantel," and he headed
for that point in the darkness of the room. He
stumbled over a chair which didn't seem to be
where it ought to be, certainly it wasn't there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
when he went out, but he reached the mantel and
began to fumble for the box which he distinctly
remembered was there.</p>

<p>"There's Gleason's stein," he said half aloud,
as his hand touched a gigantic creation with a
pewter top that he had noticed that afternoon,
"and there's the alarm clock. I'm getting hotter.
The matches were near the clock, I remember
now."</p>

<p>Frank stood still and stretched his arm out trying
to find the end of the shelf. His fingers
touched something which made him thrill and
recoil. But in spite of his quickness he felt something
grasp his wrist sharply. He tried to draw
away, but the hand, for such it was, tightened its
grip and another came to the assistance of the
first. Instantly there was the shuffling of feet,
and with a rush he was surrounded. He felt
many hands laid upon him roughly and insistently.</p>

<p>Frank fought desperately, hitting, kicking and
trying with all his strength to wrench himself
free. By twisting his arm sharply he managed
for a moment, to break the hold that someone had
on him, and shot his fist sharply out into the
darkness with all his force. It found a soft mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
somewhere on someone's face, and hurt, too, as
a grunt attested. But he was grasped still more
firmly and had no more chance to fight.</p>

<p>In the scuffle in the dark which followed, chairs
were knocked over, the table was bumped into,
and Gleason's gorgeous shade fell with a crash
to the table, and then trickled off to the floor in
many pieces. But Frank's struggles were useless,
for he was borne backwards to the floor and
pressed down by superior weight. Finally he lay
on the floor with his hands pinioned to his sides,
and a weight of bodies across his legs. Not a
word had been spoken in the struggle, but now a
voice whispered: "Strike a match, some of you.
This Indian hit me on the nose and I'm bleeding
like a stuck pig. And that won't make it any
easier for him," the voice added, vindictively.</p>

<p>There was a scratching sound and a light flared
up. Frank looked up from the floor to see himself
surrounded by half a dozen fellows masked
and completely disguised. Coats were turned
inside out, collars up and caps reversed, the better
to conceal their identity. The mask itself covered
the face from the middle of the forehead to the
upper lip, and, simple though it was, made recognition
almost impossible, particularly in the dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
light from the low turned gas jet which the conspirators
had set going.</p>

<p>Frank had been neatly trapped, and was helpless
as a baby before the superior numbers. He
was presently more helpless, for his hands were
lashed behind him with a stout leather strap.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER VI.</span><span class="subtit">HAZING AND THE WATER CURE.</span></h2>


<p>Frank studied his enemies from his lowly position
on the floor, but could not remember ever
having seen any of them, a thing that was not
strange, since his school life had only begun that
afternoon. He noted with satisfaction that one
of his assailants was at the other side of the room
trying to stop a flow of blood from his nose, which
seemed to be copious, judging from the stains
on the handkerchief which had been vigorously
applied.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?"
asked Frank at last, as his captors let him get
on his feet. He was savage at himself for having
been so easily caught.</p>

<p>"You'll see soon enough, Mr. Armstrong."</p>

<p>"No wonder," reflected Frank, "we were unable
to see the bunch of hazers when they were
snugly waiting in my own room, which they prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
by darkening with drawn curtains and
shutting off the gas in the entry outside my door.
No wonder the place was like midnight. It
would have been better if I had taken Jimmy's
advice."</p>

<p>"Come on," said the bloody-nosed one. Frank
had a notion there was a familiar ring in it. It
was like Dixon's voice and it wasn't. If it was
Dixon's, he was trying hard to change the tone
by talking down in his throat. "I'll watch that
fellow," he thought. "If it's Dixon he'll give
himself away."</p>

<p>At the word of command to move, two boys
grabbed Frank, one by each arm, and another
stepped behind him.</p>

<p>"Hold on," said one of them, "we've got to tie
up his face or he'll be yelling for help, and that
won't do." The words were hardly out of the
speaker's mouth when Frank felt a muffler flung
over his head and face. It was tied securely behind,
effectually shutting out his vision and making
it a difficult matter to raise an outcry. Then
the march was continued.</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h&mdash;, someone's coming," said a voice
just as they had reached the entry outside his
own door, "quick, go up the stairs," and Frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
felt himself headed for the floor above the one
they were on. A door banged below, and someone
began mounting the stairs.</p>

<p>"What in thunder's this light out for? Some
youngster with a poor sense of humor." It was
Gleason's voice, and he was scolding to himself
because of the murderous blackness. He came
climbing up the stairs, stopped at his door, pushed
it open and entered.</p>

<p>"Quick," commanded the voice ahead of Frank.
"Make a break for the bottom and see that Armstrong
doesn't get a chance to speak."</p>

<p>In another instant the captors and captured retraced
their steps, a hand being slipped over
Frank's mouth in addition to the muffler, to make
sure of his silence.</p>

<p>"Bring him around back of Warren," whispered
one of the leaders, and in a minute they
had cut through the dark passage at the south
end of Warren. Frank could not even make a
guess where they were headed for, as he was
not yet well enough acquainted with the lay of
the buildings. He felt himself going down a
grassy decline, then through some shrubbery
which caught at his clothes, and then again where
the grass seemed short and the turf firm. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
seemed like a lawn to him, but as he had been
turned around two or three times, he had not
the faintest notion after five minutes' travelling
where he was.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?" he finally managed
to mumble to the fellow who had a grip
of him by the right arm.</p>

<p>"We're going to give you the stretching treatment,
my son."</p>

<p>Frank was not acquainted with it. The voice
went on:</p>

<p>"Don't you know that you committed a grievous
sin, a very grievous sin, when you talked back
this afternoon?" Frank said nothing. "You
don't think you're guilty. Well, the highest court
of justice in this school sat on your case to-night,
condemned you, and turned you over to the executioners,
and them's us."</p>

<p>"We are now on our way to the gallows," said
a voice to his left in a sepulchral whisper.</p>

<p>Still no reply from Frank. He had made up
his mind, since he was in their power, to take
his medicine, no matter what it was.</p>

<p>The group tramped on in silence for several
minutes, and then stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"Here's the spot," said one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Got the rope?"</p>

<p>"Yes," and there was the sound of a coil of
rope falling on the soft grass.</p>

<p>"Coffin ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all ready, waiting for the fresh guy that
is to occupy it."</p>

<p>In spite of Frank's sturdy heart, a shiver ran
down his spine. He felt as though he were in
the grip of some horrible nightmare. Perhaps
it was a dream after all. He pinched himself to
see if he were awake. But the pinch made him
wince, and the two fellows hanging onto his arms,
one at each side, were too real to be any part of
a dream. What could they be meaning to do to
him? Of course, they wouldn't dare injure him,
but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"All ready," said a voice. "Prisoner, have you
anything to say before you swing? No tongue,
eh? Well, executioner, proceed."</p>

<p>There was a stir in the crowd, and Frank felt
himself pushed forward into what he supposed
was a circle. They wouldn't dare do it, he was
saying to himself, but his nerve was sorely tried.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came the sound of someone
running across the grass. "A pardon, a pardon
for Frank Armstrong," said a new voice. "Hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
sentence commuted to the water cure and
imprisonment for life!"</p>

<p>"Curses," growled the chief executioner.
"Snatched from me grasp! We would have had
him strung up in a minute. Why didn't you lose
your way, Paul Revere?"</p>

<p>"Well, since we can't hang him, let's proceed
to the water cure. Hurry it up," growled a voice,
which in spite of an assumed gruffness put him
strongly in mind of Dixon's.</p>

<p>Frank was seized again and they walked rapidly
for several minutes in what seemed to him
an opposite direction from which he had come
the first part of the journey. Soon their footsteps
sounded on wood, which echoed flatly to
their tread. It seemed like a platform. And
there was the faint sound of lapping water. Could
it be the river? It was the river, and when the
bandage slipped from his face he saw that they
were standing on the boat-house float. The river
ran past, dark and silent.</p>

<p>"Halt. Prisoner, attention!" commanded a
voice, a new one to Frank.</p>

<p>"You can swim?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's the wonderful boy champion of Milton,"
said a sneering voice.</p>

<p>"Stood the world's champion off on a ten-mile
race," said one.</p>

<p>"Set new records from 12 inches to a foot,"
said another.</p>

<p>"And got the big head about it, and sassed our
valiant quarterback."</p>

<p>How Frank hated the reporter who had printed
the story about his swimming. He almost hated
Burton for teaching and himself for learning how
to swim. It seemed to be bringing him only
trouble. He had done nothing to deserve it.</p>

<p>"We want a little exhibition, Mr. Champion
Armstrong," said the voice again, which sounded
more than ever like Chip's. "Strip."</p>

<p>"The water's too cold," said Frank, startled
when he found it was their intention to put him
into the river.</p>

<p>"Keep going when you are in. Who ever
heard of a champion being afraid of cold water?
Off with your clothes, and be quick about it.
You've got a minute to shed them or in you go
with them on."</p>

<p>Frank began reluctantly to undress, looking,
out of the corner of his eye, at the dark surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of the river, silvery cold under the moon's rays.
He watched for a possible avenue of escape,
thinking that perhaps a bold dash might give
him his liberty, but his captors formed a half
circle about him, and the open side of the circle
lay towards the black river.</p>

<p>Apparently there was nothing for it but to go
in or be chucked in, and Frank chose the former.
He slipped off his clothes, and put them in a pile
on the float and turned toward the water.</p>

<p>"You've got to go across to the other side,
Armstrong. If you renig we'll chuck your clothes
in after you. And don't turn your head till you
get there, or it will be worse for you."</p>

<p>Frank waited to hear no more, but sprang
boldly out into the water. How the first touch
of the cold water grabbed him! It was like a
knife thrust, for the night was in the middle of
October, and the coldness of the air had transferred
itself to the surface. Below it was warmer,
however, and he let his body sink to get the full
benefit of the warmth, and struck out for the
opposite shore, which was at this point perhaps
seventy-five yards away. Soon the blood began
to come back to his skin with a glow, and as he
paddled away he thought it not so bad after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>About midstream he slackened up a moment
and looked back to the float, thinking perhaps
he would be permitted to come back.</p>

<p>"Go on," commanded a voice, and seeing no
help for it, Frank put down his head and dug
for the opposite shore as fast as he could go.
He reached the bank, which was gently shelving,
in short order, pulled himself up and looked
back.</p>

<p>The float was deserted, nor could a soul be
seen anywhere, although the moon's rays lighted
up the whole place as bright as day.</p>

<p>Even at that distance he could see his little
pile of clothes by the side of the float. He heard
the faint murmur of the river at his feet, and
away off behind him in the marshes a big bullfrog
singing his evening song with a chorus of
deep-throated croakings.</p>

<p>"They've gone, unless they're planning some
more trouble for me," said Frank, bitterly, to
himself. "They must have ducked behind the
boat-house and are now on the way back to the
school in the shadow of the trees."</p>

<p>He pushed into the water, shivering, and set
out for the float, which seemed a long distance
away. The water slipped gurgling between his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
fingers as he drew his hands through on the
stroke, giving him a creepy sensation. He felt
that the denizens of the river were staring at
him, this strange white body so queerly afloat at
such a time of night. He shuddered and drove
faster for the float, and felt a great relief when
his hand touched the wooden edge.</p>

<p>Frank pulled himself up, and looked carefully
around. His tormentors had disappeared as
absolutely as if they had been swallowed up in
the river, and everything was as still as death except
the frog chorus in the marshes, and the
occasional cheep of a cricket on the river bank.
Lights twinkled in the windows of Warren, and
as he listened, the school bell boomed out the
hour of nine thirty.</p>

<p>"Gee, whiz, I'll be locked out if I don't hurry,"
he whispered to himself, and he plunged into his
clothes with the greatest alacrity, his teeth chattering.
How the clothes stuck to him and clasped
his wet skin clammily! "Never knew till now
how handy a towel is," he muttered. But he was
finally clothed, and a brisk run up through the
field put the blood in circulation.</p>

<p>When Frank reached his room, Gleason was
preparing for bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, my night owl, where have you been?
Thought maybe you'd got homesick so soon and
had started for the busy city of Milton,"
was Gleason's greeting. Then, seeing Frank's
hair wet, he added: "Been giving the mermaids
a serenade, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just been having a bit of a swim," said
Frank. "Good thing for a fellow at night, you
know, makes him sleep well."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" was all Gleason could say.
"Swimming at this time of night in the river!
Well, my eye, you are a funny one. Web-foot,
you are for sure and all. Well, you can use the
river, but I prefer the good old porcelain bathtub
for mine after September first."</p>

<p>"Nothing like the outdoors swimming, you
know," said Frank, "and at night you don't startle
the surrounding scenery. I'm off for bed. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night," called Gleason, who had also
dived into his sleeping-room. "I say, what were
you doing up here when I was gone? I found my
lampshade busted when I came, chairs upset, curtains
drawn tight and all that. Little rough-house,
eh?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, just a little rough-house to celebrate my
arrival at Queen's."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Gleason, "I found a leather wristlet
over by the mantel when I was picking up the
debris. Maybe it belongs to one of your friends."</p>

<p>"Maybe it does; where is it?"</p>

<p>"On the table there; if you dig around you will
find it."</p>

<p>Frank went quickly to the table where the
wristlet lay in plain sight. He picked it up, examining
it curiously. It was made of leather about
two inches wide, with two small brass buckles
which allowed the strap to be drawn up tightly.
Such wristlets were often worn to strengthen
and protect a weak wrist. He had noticed that
afternoon that two of the football squad wore
just such wristlets as these. Could it be one of
them? He turned the leather over and over, and
started as his eyes fell on the initials C. D. inked
on the inside of one of the straps. "Chip Dixon,
by goodness! I'll keep this for future use. It
may come in handy more ways than one, Mr.
Dixon."</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER VII.</span><span class="subtit">SCHOOL SPIRIT AND SCHOOL INFLUENCES.</span></h2>


<p>Next morning Frank made the acquaintance
of Dr. Hobart, principal of Queen's School. The
Doctor had the reputation of being severe, a terror
to wrong doers, but gentle enough withal
when things went right. He was a mere wisp
of a man, about sixty years old, not over five
feet tall, and with a thin, narrow face and parchment-like
skin. His shoulders were bowed a little,
perhaps with his weight of learning, for Dr.
Hobart was considered one of the best of preparatory
school leaders. Indeed, his reputation went
far and wide, and the excellence of his school
brought him pupils from many parts of the country.</p>

<p>The Doctor's distinguishing feature was his
eyes, or rather eye, for he only had one which
nature gave him. His natural left eye had many
years before been injured and removed. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
now replaced by one of glass, and the fixed and
unwinking position of it when the Doctor was
aroused bored straight through the soul of the
culprit before him and came out the other side,
or so it seemed to the unfortunate who faced him,
accused of misdeeds. It would be a brazen youth,
indeed, who could stand before that penetrating
glance from under the shaggy brows.</p>

<p>Frank had heard a good deal about the Doctor,
and it was with some trepidation that he
approached the august presence in his quarters
on the first floor, third entry of Warren.</p>

<p>"Old Glass-eye is a ring-snorter," Gleason had
told him. "They say he dines off freshmen. I'm
a brave man, but I was glad when he was through
with me. I was so flim-fazzled when he turned
that glass orb of his on me that I couldn't have
told whether the amateur hundred-yard record
had set at ten seconds or half an hour."</p>

<p>But the Doctor was in one of his most amiable
moods when Frank was ushered into his presence.</p>

<p>"This is the late-comer, is it?" he inquired, gently.</p>

<p>Frank interpreted it as a criticism, and hurried
to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But I couldn't very well help being
late. I was away for my health, and my parents
didn't really intend to have me go to school till
after Christmas, but I made such good progress
that they thought it best to get me in as early
as possible, after all."</p>

<p>"H'm; and I suppose you wanted to come?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir. I like school, and I hope to go
to college if I can keep up my work here and
pass the examinations."</p>

<p>"So you're going to college. That's good. We
can give you the training here; the rest of it depends
on yourself. Where do you expect to go
to college, my young friend?" and the Doctor
brought his baleful eye to bear on Frank.</p>

<p>"York, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good, very good. You are going in for
athletics, Mr. Armstrong?"</p>

<p>"Just a little, sir. Do you advise it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Armstrong, I advise athletics&mdash;just
a little, as you say. But one thing I insist upon,
that whatever you go in for, it must be wholeheartedly.
The great curse of the present time
is the spirit of dabbling. Don't be a dabbler."
And the glass eye transfixed his hearer. "Whatever
you do, do well. When you are in the class-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
do what you have to do. Make your time
count. When you study, study; when you play,
play. If you go out on the athletic field, make
the most of it, and if you go into any sport, carry
it to the highest point of development you can
consistent with the time you have to give it. Athletics
are only another kind of education, and
carried on in the right way they very powerfully
supplement the work of the class-room. And,
above all things, play fair. Play hard, but play
fair. Win if you can, but be a gentleman in your
winning, and in your defeat, if you meet defeat,
as you will in school and out of it. You have
the appearance of quality in your face. You have
a chance here to show what you can do in the
class-room and on the field. Whatever you do,
make yourself felt. Make yourself respected, but
also make yourself felt. Respect your schoolmates
worthy of respect, and make them respect
you by your uprightness.</p>

<p>"I did not mean to make this a lecture, my
boy," added the Doctor, pleasantly, the bushy eyebrows
drawing into a kindlier line. "I want to
help set you straight on this school road, which
is not so easy as it may appear to you. If you
ever want advice, and you think I can help you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
come to me without hesitation. I am not so
black, maybe, as I'm painted," and the Doctor's
right eye assumed a kindly twinkle. "And now,"
he continued, "go over to Mr. Parks, whom you
will find in Russell, and he will give you an outline
of your school work and assign your classes.
Good morning."</p>

<p>"By Jove! he's a brick," said Frank, as he hurried
across the yard. "I thought I was going
to find a bear, and he was nothing more than
a kindly human being with a whole reservoir of
good advice."</p>

<p>Mr. Parks, the assistant master, inducted
Frank into the school routine, and the boy's school
life began that morning auspiciously. He felt
that he had made a good friend in the Doctor,
and he was bent on satisfying his demand as
far as studies were concerned. As to how he
would make his way with his schoolmates, was
another matter, and he approached it with less
of a feeling of certainty.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon of that day Frank made
a call on his old friend Jimmy, who was industriously
working up his history; but when Frank
put his head in at the door, the history book was
shut with a snap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, Web-foot, how did you get along last
night? No hazers, I hope."</p>

<p>"Got along finely," said Frank, "in spite of
lots of excitement. Took a forced swim in the
Wampaug last night, preceded by a young scrap
in No. 18, and this morning I had a session
with the Doctor, who gave me enough good advice
to keep me straight in line through the whole
school course."</p>

<p>"The dickens you say!" exclaimed Jimmy.
"You don't mean to say that they got you after
all?"</p>

<p>"They certainly did, got me good and hard.
Started out to stretch my neck down on the meadows
somewhere,&mdash;that was the sentence they
said,&mdash;and then changed their minds, not being
willing to sacrifice a budding young genius like
myself, and gave me the water cure."</p>

<p>"The water cure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the water cure, which consisted in making
me swim the river, after nine o'clock, and
back in my bare pelt."</p>

<p>Jimmy was indignant. "By George, that was
tough. Who did it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; half a dozen fellows were
waiting for me in my room, dumped me on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
floor, tied my hands, carried me off with a muffler
around my face, and then, when I was half way
across the Wampaug, skipped and left me."</p>

<p>"Was Chip Dixon in the gang that hazed you?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell. The fellows were all masked."</p>

<p>"It's a beastly shame," blurted out Jimmy.
"It'll come out, see if it don't, and I wouldn't
give a licked postage stamp for the chances of
the fellows who did it, if it comes to the Doctor's
ears. I've a notion to go out and play detective.
To think that I was studying here quietly, and
you were being ducked in the river not two hundred
yards away!" And Jimmy jumped up and
began to walk around the floor, threatening vengeance
on the perpetrators of the outrage.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you bother about it. It gave them
lots of fun, and it didn't hurt me," said Frank.
"The water sure was chilly when I struck it first,
but the swim wasn't long. It made me sleep like
a top. And perhaps some good may come out
of it."</p>

<p>Jimmy continued to growl, but Frank laughed
the incident away, and the talk turned on the
afternoon's football practice which Horton had
threatened would be a stiff one.</p>

<p>"Speaking of football," said Jimmy, "why don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
you go out and do a little something for your
newly adopted school?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't be any good. I'd like to try
it, all right. But I've got my work cut out for
me, staying in school without mixing up in football
this fall anyway. Maybe by the time hockey
comes around I'll do some work if I'm standing
well enough to escape the terrible eye of the Doctor.
But for this fall at least I'll do most of my
football work on the bleachers, and giving the
right halfback of the eleven friendly advice."</p>

<p>"No luck like that for me. I guess I'm not
much good and I don't stand well enough with
the ruling powers. But maybe, bye-and-bye, I'll
get a chance. In the meantime I'll keep pushing
and learn all I can. Horton knows the game,
doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the way he spotted the bad play on both
teams was a caution. He must have twenty pairs
of eyes."</p>

<p>At this moment in the conversation Lewis
strolled into the room. "I've decided," he announced
with heavy dignity, "to cut out football.
I've been getting on pretty well at it, and the
coach doesn't want me to drop out now when I'm
pretty sure of a place" (Jimmy and Frank exchanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
winks), "but I feel my studies need my
time. I think I'll go out for the Whitney Fellowship.
So you fellows will have to get along
without my society down on the gridiron."</p>

<p>"Bad, too bad," murmured Jimmy. "Such a
chance, too, for the team, just now when you'd
be put in at center. It would be a great thing
for Milton, too, to have a representative on the
great Queen's School eleven. It would be headlines
for the papers. Sorry you can't give it
the time."</p>

<p>"And speaking of time," said Frank, "isn't it
about time you were getting under way for the
gym? I think I see the gathering of the clans
from here," he added, looking out of the window
in the direction of the field.</p>

<p>"Wonder what Mr. Dixon will feel like when
Lewis announces his intention of retiring from
the squad," said Jimmy, with a wink, as he prepared
to leave.</p>

<p>"And I wonder what Mr. Dixon will do to
one James Turner," retorted Lewis.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess he won't bother him very much,"
said Frank.</p>

<p>"Is that so? Well, you don't know that youngster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
as well as we do. You'll hear things about
him when you've been here a little longer."</p>

<p>"I've heard some things and seen some others,
and perhaps I know Mr. Dixon better than he
thinks I do. And I'm not far wrong when I say
that that young fellow will not bother Jimmy too
much."</p>

<p>"Yes, you'll jump in and hand our lively young
quarter a few straight digs in the ribs, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Maybe so, but he had better keep himself to
himself."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on here, stop your scrapping. Come
on and watch the emaciated Second, now that
Lewis has left us, being smeared by the riotous
First. Oh, I hate to think of it," cried Jimmy,
dashing out of the door.</p>

<p>When the squad reported for practice at four
o'clock sharp, Horton had on his business face
and he lost no time in getting things moving.
"I'm going to see if these two teams know anything
about football at all. We've been dodging
around here playing tag for a month. Now we've
got to begin to play football. Let's have a little
punting and see if you backs can hold the ball to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>The backs were divided into two squads, and
two of the best punters were sent up to the middle
of the field, with a center to snap the ball. Boston
Wheeler&mdash;his Sunday name was Worthington,
but Boston was handier, and better described
him, as he came from that famous city known
as "the Hub"&mdash;was punting the ball in long, lazy
curves which carried thirty yards, and then
dropped head first, much to the disgust of the
racing backs.</p>

<p>"Mine," yelled Spud Dudley as with hands outstretched
and neck craned he drove for one of
Wheeler's high ones.</p>

<p>But he misjudged, as the ball dropped too
straight for him and bounced around on the
group. The wrath of the coach was drawn upon
him instantly.</p>

<p>"What do you think you are catching, Dudley,
a featherbed? Get under those high ones. They
drop quick when they come spinning with the long
axis parallel to the ground. Don't let them catch
you napping. And haven't I told you to make
a little pocket for the ball between your hands,
which must be held closer together, and your
chest? Then the ball can't get away from you.
That's better, Freshman." This was directed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Jimmy, who took a low end-over-end punt from
Dobson, the other punter, at top speed. "I don't
know where that Freshman got it, but he has the
right idea about catching punts," Horton added.</p>

<p>Punting practice went on for five minutes or
so, and then, after a brief signal drill between the
First and Second elevens, the coach called both
teams to the middle of the field.</p>

<p>"Now, this is the last practice game before the
Barrows game, and I want you to do your best.
You can win easily if you will only forget about
yourselves, and play for the team. Let's see you
do it. Come on, every one into it," and the whistle
spoke out shrilly for the beginning of the practice
game.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>


<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER VIII.</span><span class="subtit">QUEEN'S MEETS BARROWS AT FOOTBALL.</span></h2>

<p>In spite of Horton's appeal for good playing,
the sample of football that the First team gave
was anything but encouraging. The coach was
all over the field, exhorting his charges to their
best efforts, but their best efforts fell very far
short of what he wanted.</p>

<p>After the kick-off, the First had made some
good gains through the Second's Line. Then
Dutton missed his signals and lost a lot of ground.
He stood dumbly with the ball in his hands while
the opposing tackle came ripping through the line,
seized him around the waist, and ran him ten
yards back towards his own goal before Dutton
could yell "down."</p>

<p>"Isn't that the limit of all things?" said the
Wee One to Frank. They were sitting together
on the bleachers with a bunch of other critics,
passing judgment on the playing, good and bad,
as they saw it enacted before them. The Wee
One was a critic of no mean calibre. "Isn't that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the limit of all things? If they could only perform
an operation on the thing that Dutton calls
his head and get some grey matter from a jackass
and insert it, he might possibly remember
some of the signals,&mdash;at least such little ones as
'straight through the line,' which is about all he's
good for anyway."</p>

<p>"Guess Horton's going to have apoplexy now,
isn't he?" inquired Frank, as he watched the
coach striding about among the players, shaking
his clinched fists. But Horton recovered himself,
and commanded another scrimmage. This
time the First pulled itself together, and under
the urgings of the quarter and the vigorous
coaching of Horton, tore through the Second for
great gains. It was fast and furious, slang, bang,
up-and-at-it-again football, and the Second was
retreating down the field, doing its best to hold
its ground, but being swept aside by the rushes
of the giant Dutton.</p>

<p>It was first down on the Second's ten-yard line,
and it looked like a touchdown. The First was
about to take revenge for the rebuffs the Second
eleven had been giving them for several days.</p>

<p>"Now," shrilled Chip at the top of his lungs,
"put it over. 16&mdash;32&mdash;11."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hillard's signal for a tackle-shaving play,"
translated the Wee One, and Hillard was off like
a shot for, say what you might about his uncertainty
with the ball, he was extremely fast on
his feet, and when he was able to hang onto the
ball he could be depended on to make ground.
But poor Hillard, whose star had been bright
that afternoon, was in so great a hurry to start
that he missed the more important matter of
securing the ball firmly. It dropped to the
ground. He made a step in its direction, but
misfortune upon misfortune, kicked it with
his foot and sent it rolling towards the end of
the line where an alert end of the Second team
pounced upon it.</p>

<p>The whistle in Horton's lips shrieked savagely,
a signal to stop play. The First eleven gathered
together stupidly, and scowled back savagely at
the members of the Second, who stepped around
elastically and grinned broadly.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be in Hillard's place for a row of
apple trees all in full bloom," ventured the Wee
One. "Something's coming to him, all right.
What did I tell you?" as Horton raised his voice
so everyone could hear it:</p>

<p>"Hillard, you may go to the sideline. I've got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
to have some one who can keep his fingers around
a ball. You've thrown away all the good work
your team has done. I won't need you again for
some time." Horton delivered his sentence in a
calm voice, and then turned towards the sidelines
where some of the substitutes were seated.
"Where's that Freshman who played on the Second
yesterday afternoon?" he said. "Hey, there,
Turner, take Hillard's place. We'll see if you can
hold the ball."</p>

<p>"Hurray!" cried Frank, jumping to his feet in
excitement, "Jimmy's going to get his chance.
That's great, and he's got it in spite of Mr.
Dixon."</p>

<p>"And that will peeve Dixon," chuckled the Wee
One. "There they go."</p>

<p>Jimmy was on the field in a flash, and his
sweater was slung behind him as he ran.</p>

<p>"Now," said Horton, "I'm going to give you a
chance here, and if you make good you may get
in the game to-morrow. Your business is just
now to follow your signal, and hold onto the ball.
The signals are the same you have been playing
under. Come on." And the whistle sounded.
"Here, First eleven, take this ball again on the
fifteen-yard line and try it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>On the very first play, Dixon gave the ball to
Jimmy, who, following close behind his tackle,
who opened a convenient door in the opposing
line, went half the distance to the goal line.</p>

<p>"Good work!" shouted the coach.</p>

<p>Dutton on the next down sliced between tackle
and guard, and got three yards and first down.</p>

<p>"I hope they don't put it up to Jimmy to make
that four yards," said Frank, "it looks like a
mile."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll bet Chip gives him the ball. He
won't give him anything easy to do, and Chip
would rather not score than let him cinch Hillard's
place."</p>

<p>The Wee One was right, for the next instant
Jimmy had the ball, and was ploughing into the
line with his head down. Then he was lost in
a heaving mass, but somehow slipped out of it,
emerged free, and threw himself across the goal
line. The First had scored. "Good work, Freshman,"
said the coach, but the quarterback turned
and walked up the field sulkily.</p>

<p>For the rest of the afternoon's practice Jimmy
fairly outdid himself. When he went into the
line the ball seemed to be a part of him, and he
rarely failed to make his distance. With his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
short, strong legs, thick neck and powerful back,
he bored and squirmed through the smallest holes.
On defence he was in every pile, and generally
at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>"That boy has real football instinct," said Horton
to Mr. Parks, who came down to the gridiron
to look on. "He is green yet, but he is going to
make a good one, you will see. He doesn't know
anything about carrying the ball, yet he carries
it, and he doesn't know anything about the science
of tackling, but he stops his man. Where on earth
he learned what he has, I don't know."</p>

<p>And Mr. Parks agreed that a new football
player had come to town.</p>

<p>Practice finally ended. Horton's "That's
enough for to-day," brought Frank scampering
down from the stand to walk joyfully along beside
his old playmate to the gymnasium.</p>

<p>"Knew you could do it, Jimmy," he said, as he
trudged along with the perspiring hero of the
afternoon, who was well hooded up in a blanket
to keep the rather chilly October breeze off his
overheated body. "It was great to see you."
Frank's eyes fairly shone with pleasure. He took
a greater pride in it than if it had been his own
success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Glad I gave up the game," said Lewis, now
in everyday clothes. "Two great football players
in one room would have been more than Warren
could have supported, eh Frank?" Frank was so
happy that he would have agreed to anything that
afternoon.</p>

<p>Barrows came down in great force the next
afternoon, and the light blue of the Academy was
flaunted everywhere on the yard of old Queen's.
The followers of Barrows freely boasted a coming
victory for their eleven, and, if truth must
be told, the eleven was worthy of the confidence
expressed. Barrows Academy drew from an
older class of boys than did the Queen's School,
many of its inmates on graduation going directly
into business, for which it, in a measure, fitted
them.</p>

<p>"Did you see those giants on the Barrows
team?" quoth the Wee One, meeting Frank on his
way to a geometry recitation. "They must have
imported them from the foundry."</p>

<p>"It's a fact, they do look mountainous alongside
some of our fellows," admitted Frank, "but
we ought to know more football, we certainly
have the best coach."</p>

<p>"The coach part of it is all right," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Wee One, "and we know football, or, at least,
ought to, but we don't seem to be able to get it
out of our system."</p>

<p>The game was set for three o'clock, and long
before that hour there was an exodus of the entire
school, for class-room work on Saturdays closed
at noon. The game was considered something
of a test for Queen's, which had been playing
very erratic ball all the year. There was a good
deal of grumbling about the way that the Gamma
was running things through its captain, Harding,
and Chip Dixon, who seemed to have a powerful
influence over Harding. A good many thought
that the best players in the school were not having
a fair trial, but as yet there had been no open
revolt. Real rebellion against the rule of Gamma
Tau still held off, but there were grumblings on
the horizon which indicated a storm if things
did not improve. And to-day was a chance for
the crowd in control to show that they were playing
the kind of ball expected from such a school
as Queen's with such a coach as Horton.</p>

<p>Frank escorted Jimmy to the gymnasium that
afternoon, where the teams were to dress for the
fray, and the Freshman halfback was in a fever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of excitement. Frank buzzed along with encouragement
in every word.</p>

<p>"If I can only hang onto the ball," Jimmy
would say, "but I had a notion yesterday two or
three times that Dixon was trying to make it
hard for me to get the pass. Once I nearly
dropped it, and I was scared to death, for the
coach was right alongside of me. My heart went
as far down as my shin guards for sure."</p>

<p>"I'll watch him for any tricks like that,"
thought Frank, but to Jimmy he said never a
word. It might only be Jimmy's imagination in
his excitement.</p>

<p>"All I've got to say to you," said Horton to
his charges when they were dressed and ready,
"is to attend to business and play as a team, and
think about what you are doing. These fellows
are bigger than you, and you will have to outwit
them. Use your heads and keep together. Now,
skip."</p>

<p>In the first collision of the game, the big fellows
from Barrows swept the lighter Queen's
School back as though they were made of paper,
and screams of delight rose from the stand where
had gathered the hosts of Barrows. Down the
field they went&mdash;five yards through tackle, ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
yards around the end, five yards through center.
Twice the attack had bowled Jimmy over after
breaking down the line, and twice he had been
able to stop the rush dead, without a gain. Once
he had the joy of pushing the Barrows' halfback
through the hole he came for at a loss of
a yard.</p>

<p>"Look at Jimmy Turner, the Freshman,"
shouted the Wee One. "If they would all play
like that kid we'd have a chance."</p>

<p>"What's Dutton doing,&mdash;Oh, what's he dreaming
about? Missed his man. Did you ever see
such a dope?"</p>

<p>"Turner got the Barrows' chap that time.
Good for Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Hold 'em, Queen's, hold 'em."</p>

<p>But the Barrows' attack was not wonderfully
varied, and little by little the advance was cut
down as the Academy eleven began to approach
the Queen's goal.</p>

<p>"Get together, get together, Queen's, and stop
them," begged Captain Harding, and working
like one, the boys responded to his cry.</p>

<p>It was third down on Queen's 12-yard line,
with a yard to go, and the Barrows' backs held
a consultation. The stands speculated as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
whether they would try to carry it, or try a drop
kick. For the latter piece of football, the aggressors
were in a good position. But finally they
elected to rush, and settled carefully down to
position, balanced on their toes, and alert for the
signal. If they could make their distance, it
looked hopeless for Queen's, for the remaining
yards to go for a touchdown would be easy, so
the spectators figured.</p>

<p>The whistle shrieked, and the lines came together
with a bang. Humphrey, the Barrows
quarter, who had been playing a fine game and
directing the team like a general, now made his
first mistake. Thinking that the going was too
hard through the line, he sent his fleetest halfback
on a delayed pass out around right end.
For a moment it looked as though he had made
a master stroke. Campbell, the Queen's right
end, was drawn in because he believed the play
was to be made on the other side of the line,
but Jimmy had interpreted correctly, too late,
however, to warn Campbell. The Queen's tackle
came through hard, and halted the Barrows' runner
a minute, just long enough to let Jimmy get
under way.</p>

<p>The Barrows' back ran behind an interference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of the fullback, half and quarter, and it looked
like a hopeless task to break this compact mass.
Jimmy followed the interference out, crowding
it back as well as he could, watching his chance.
Suddenly he realized that the runner with the
ball was outdistancing not only Jimmy himself,
but his own interference. Jimmy felt that he
could not handle them all, and he could not hope
to get through the interference alone and get
his hands on the runner. He did the only thing
possible,&mdash;that is, he threw himself with unerring
instinct against the knees of the interference, in
a kind of side-dive. The effect was instantaneous.
The interference was running so closely
massed that there was no chance for them to
dodge, and they went down over the Freshman's
body in a tangle. The runner with the ball was
so close that he, too, went sprawling, heels over
head, and before he was able to get to his feet,
big Boston Wheeler had pinned him down. It
was Queen's ball.</p>

<p>How the Queen's stand did yell: "Turner,
Turner, oh, you Turner!"</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Turner!"</p>

<p>"Rah, rah, rah, Turner, Turner, Turner!"</p>

<p>One might have thought there was only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
man on the Queen's School eleven. At the cheers
for Turner, although his halfback's action had
probably saved the team from a score, Dixon's
face took on a sour look. There was too much
Turner in the game to suit him. It was a malicious
eye he turned on Jimmy.</p>

<p>From this point, Queen's took up the march
down the field, and steadily, as Barrows had come
into Queen's territory, so steadily did the Queen's
eleven fight their way back, and gradually it began
to dawn on the partisans of Queen's School
that they had a chance. Five yards here and five
yards there brought the play quickly to the Academy's
20-yard line. A penalty for holding set
them back, but on a pretty fake kick Dutton went
straight through center to the five-yard line.</p>

<p>"Touchdown, touchdown," yelled the Queen's
bleachers.</p>

<p>"Good old Queen's, we have got the Wheel-barrows
where we want them."</p>

<p>"All over, but the shouting."</p>

<p>First down and on the enemy's five-yard line.
It looked certain.</p>

<p>But there are many slips in football as well
as in the everyday walks of life, for on the next
play there was a fumble, and an indescribable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
scramble to recover it. And when the scramble
was over, an Academy boy was found on top of
the leather. A groan went up from the Queen's
crowd. Down among the tumbled players two
stood erect, one was Turner and the other Dixon,
and the former had his fists clinched.</p>

<p>"Turner fumbled," said some one.</p>

<p>"Did you see what happened?" Frank cried,
excitedly, to Patterson, with whom he was sitting.</p>

<p>"Don't you think I have any eyes?" said the
Wee One, indignantly. "It was a dirty trick.
He gave the signal and threw the ball at Jimmy's
hands. Didn't give him a chance to get it. It
was a deliberate trick, a contemptible trick," he
added.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the half ended, and
Queen's came to the sidelines. Horton was raging.</p>

<p>"Turner, you disappointed me. Right in the
time we wanted you most, you failed us."</p>

<p>"It wasn't&mdash;&mdash;" began Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I don't want any excuses," said Horton,
sharply. "Hillard, go in at right half and finish
the game there."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER IX.</span><span class="subtit">WHAT CAME OF A FUMBLE.</span></h2>

<p>Things went badly for Queen's in the second
half of the game. Hillard was as brilliant and
erratic as ever, and made several dashing runs
around the ends, but he inevitably slipped up
somewhere, and his unfortunate fumbling lost
his team many more yards than he gained for
it. Chip played like a demon, trying to justify
himself in his own mind for the trick he had
played Jimmy, the team and the school. He was
in every interference and worked every instant
to put Queen's in a position to score, but it was
all to no avail. Chip was so intent on his work
with the back field that he failed to hold the team
together, and as the game went on the Queen's
presented a less and less organized effort. Barrows
slammed into them for big gains when the
Academy had the ball, and at last solved all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the Queen's attacks so completely that the old
school eleven was making no headway.</p>

<p>Finally, after an exchange of punts, Boston
Wheeler, being obliged to kick against the wind,
Barrows took up the march to Queen's goal from
the latter's 35-yard line. Queen's line was tired
physically from the pounding, and weak, for there
was not enough stamina now to resist the bigger
Academy fellows, who seemed to be growing
stronger every minute. There was no Jimmy
Turner now to drive his sturdy body fearlessly
against the oncoming Barrowites.</p>

<p>"It's all over now," said the Wee One, "the
team has lost what little fighting spirit it had at
first. They will be buried out of sight with not
even a leg to mark the graveyard."</p>

<p>Frank admitted that there was no help for it.</p>

<p>Horton walked up and down the sideline, shaking
his head, unable to stop what was coming.</p>

<p>Soon the Barrows' catapult was rammed over
the line for a touchdown. The angle was too
difficult for the goal when the ball had been
brought out, and Morton, who did the kicking,
failed. From that point on, the game was a rout.
Harding, having none of the qualities for leadership
about him, could not hold his team together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
He was useless in the emergency which was now
upon the Queen's eleven. Chip tried to help by
banging his men on the back, and crying desperately
to "hold them, hold them, show your sand."
But if they ever had any sand it had been scattered
earlier in the game.</p>

<p>And how about the Freshman halfback who
had been so unkindly thrown out of the game, and
who sat watching this second half going against
the Queen's School eleven? He was only a Freshman,
but black despair was in his heart. He
was only a Freshman, but he loved the old place,
and he wanted to have the privilege of helping
to put the school flag uppermost in all the contests
in which she had a part. And to be so
meanly tricked for no fault of his, and pitched
off the field before the whole school was almost
more than he could stand.</p>

<p>When the thing happened he was perfectly
well aware how Chip had served him, and he
sprang to his feet to settle the matter then and
there with his fists, but after a tense moment
his senses came back to him. Perhaps others
had seen what had actually happened, and he
would not have to bear the shame. But no one
seemed to have noticed it. The coach evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
had not happened to see the incident, lynx-eyed
though he was.</p>

<p>"He may have been looking aside at that moment,"
thought Jimmy, "and I mustn't blame
him. I just looked like a dummy when he turned
and saw the ball rolling around on the ground,
and a hole big enough to drive an ox-cart through
waiting for me. But I'll settle up with Dixon
some day, and I hope it isn't far off." He ground
the words out between his clinched teeth, and
his look boded no good for Chip Dixon when
the day of settlement should arrive.</p>

<p>What need is there to go into detail of that
disastrous afternoon? Three times more did the
jubilant Barrowites plough through Harding's
demoralized eleven, and when the final
whistle blew, the Queen's crowd saw the awful
record on the board of 23 to nothing. It was
the worst defeat that had ever come to Queen's
at the hands of any but Warwick. It was a sting
never to be forgotten, and only to be wiped out
with reverse figures twice the size.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad that's over," said Gleason to
Frank as the crowd slowly filed down off the
stand, and the tired teams drew each into
a knot and gave the yell for the opponents. "If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
it hadn't been for that rotten fumble of young
Turner I think the Wheel-barrows wouldn't have
gone home so full."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a fumble, Mr. Gleason," said the
Wee One, "and if you thought it was you better
run right along to the oculist and have him put
his prettiest pair of specs on you!"</p>

<p>"Oh! p'raps it was a clever little piece of legerdemain
then," grunted Gleason, but neither Frank
nor the Wee One heard him. They were hotfooting
it after Jimmy, who was tailing after
the squad with his eyes on the ground and gloom
in his heart.</p>

<p>Frank ran up behind him and slipped his arm
around his shoulder. "We saw it, Jimmy," he
said. "I didn't think he dare carry a grudge
against you so far. But it lost him the game."</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Jimmy. "They were
too heavy for us." But there was a lightening
of his spirits when he felt that the play was
not entirely misunderstood. "Dixon made it hard
for me to get the ball several times, but he always
did it so cleverly that no one could see him. I
wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it and been
the victim of it as well. He got me out and his
room-mate in."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"He got you out sure enough," said Frank.
"I suspected he would swing something against
you, and he was determined to get his room-mate
in at any cost."</p>

<p>"Yes, and it cost him the game," said Patterson.
"That's what you get for playing favorites.
I'll bet the scrub could have put up a better argument
against the Academy than the First
eleven, the way it played to-day. Wonder what
the coach will say to them?"</p>

<p>But the coach had little to say.</p>

<p>"Boys," he said, simply and without any venom
in his words, "there's something wrong with you,
and we'll try to find it next week. The way you
played to-day, you haven't the ghost of a show to
win your big game two weeks from now. You
are a sore disappointment. I've done the best I
could to show you how, but I can't go out there
on the field and play your game for you."</p>

<p>It was quite evident from Jimmy's actions that
he wanted to be let alone, so Frank and the Wee
One slipped out of the gymnasium and headed
for the school yard.</p>

<p>"Frank, what are we going to do about it?
I don't want Queen's to lose to those farmers
up the river, or I'd go to Horton with what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
know and make a clean breast of it. That would
certainly get Dixon fired from the team, but we'd
be no better off, for in spite of what you may say
about Chip, he's a peach of a quarter."</p>

<p>"Let's go to Dixon and tell him we know that
Jimmy's failure to get the ball was due to him,
and not to a stupid fumble, as it seems to have
appeared to everyone else."</p>

<p>"We'll have our trouble for our pains I think,
and I wouldn't be surprised if he fired us both
out of his room, and shied a few boots, with
feet in them, after us. Chip's got a bad temper,
and he's not in a good humor just now."</p>

<p>"Let's try Harding. Even if he is a dummy,
I don't think he'd stand for Dixon making a
goat out of him and the rest of his team simply
because he wants his room-mate and a brother
Gamma to play."</p>

<p>"No use, Frank. Harding hasn't spunk
enough. He's a pretty fair end, but he has no
more business to be captain than I have to challenge
for the heavyweight championship of the
world. I'm afraid we can't do anything without
busting up this whole eleven."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose the Doctor would do if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
it was proven to him that Chip threw the game
away for a favorite?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Well, if I know anything about Old Glass-eye,
I'd say he'd put a stop to the meteoric career of
this football eleven of ours. And that's what
I don't want to see. If we can only force Chip
to drop his grudge against Turner, and get down
to business, we might still have a fighting chance,
but it's hopeless I'm afraid. The whole of
Gamma Tau is behind him. And the worst of it
is he's knocked poor Jimmy, and has done it so
cleverly that even Horton thinks Jimmy's unreliable
in a tight pinch, and if there's anything
Horton won't forgive a man for, it is to fail
when he is most needed. With no one strong
enough to push his case and the captain and
Dixon dead against him, there's not much more
chance for Turner now."</p>

<p>Frank had been thinking hard, and now he
stopped dead in his tracks.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he said, "I think I know a way to
force Chip Dixon to do as we want to have him.
If he doesn't do it, there's a fair chance of his
ending his career here. I hate to be mean, but
when the other fellow is mean and will not let
up, we've got to meet him with his own weapons."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, fire away, young Sleuth; do you hold
a deadly secret over his head? Out with it if
you do."</p>

<p>Frank quickly gave the Wee One a description
of the hazing, which was interrupted very frequently
by Patterson with snorts of indignation.</p>

<p>"I'll bet Dixon was mixed up in that affair.
If we only knew, we'd fix him."</p>

<p>"But supposing we did know?"</p>

<p>"We'd have him where the wool was short
and the skin tender."</p>

<p>"Well, that's just it, for when I got back to
the room that night Gleason had picked up a
wristlet that Chip wore the first day I came here.
I haven't seen a wristlet on him since. I looked
particularly to-day, and he had none on."</p>

<p>"Any marks on the wristlet you found?" inquired
the Wee One, eagerly, beginning to catch
the drift of Frank's plan.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'C. D.' inked plainly on the inside of one
of the small straps, and besides that I made a
hunt in the grass near the boat-house the next
morning, trying to trace out the way we went to
the river, and accidentally came across the strap
with which they tied my hands, and on that was
printed Chip's full name. It looks like one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the straps which go around an extension grip.
Here it is, and here's the leather wristlet."</p>

<p>"Jumping geewhillikins! Come to my arms,
you Sherlock Holmes. We have Chip Dixon
where we want him. This seems to be certain
proof, and if we gave the story to Glass-eye, Chip
wouldn't last long enough to pack his suit case.
The old man is dead down on hazers since the
accident we had here two years ago. He gives
every new class a red-hot talk about it.</p>

<p>"To-night you and I will make a call on Mr.
Dixon," added the Wee One, who had now thoroughly
espoused the Freshman's cause, not only
for that individual's sake, but for the sake of
justice to the school. "I'll come over to-night
after supper, and we will have a little session
with our shifty quarterback, which, I think, will
make him so gentle that he'll eat off our hand.
So long, see you about half-past seven," and
the Wee One tore off, but not before Frank had
time to shout: "This is all between ourselves."</p>

<p>"Sure," returned the Wee One, "ourselves and
Mr. Christopher."</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>


<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER X.</span><span class="subtit">FRANK SPRINGS A SURPRISE.</span></h2>


<p>When Frank and the Wee One knocked on
Dixon's door that night in the second entry, first
floor of Russell Hall, it must be confessed that
they were not as brave as they had felt themselves
to be earlier in the evening when the plan of
campaign had been decided. Frank felt that he
had been at Queen's too short a time to be taking
the high hand with the quarterback of the eleven,
and he was uncertain as to how it would affect
his standing in the school.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Willie, I wish there was some other
way to get at this," Frank said as they cut across
the broad walk under the elms.</p>

<p>"Have you some other plan under your bonnet?"</p>

<p>"No, that's the worst of it. I don't like the
idea of being put in the position of forcing Jimmy
on the eleven."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, what are you sticking at? If you don't
do it the force will be on Jimmy to keep him off.
It may be too late even now, for Jimmy had his
chance, and to most of those who saw the game
the indications were that he is not to be trusted
with the ball in a tight place. We know better
because we were suspicious of Chip and had a
guess as to what he might be up to."</p>

<p>"All right," said Frank, "but just the same I
wish we could get at it in a different way. Probably
all on account of me, Jimmy will now get
in bad with the Gamma crowd. I wish I hadn't
come to school at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, if you are getting chills in your
pedal extremities we will go back and put you to
bed and warm you up with a hot water bottle.
But if you are looking for victory, as Napoleon
said, 'follow me into the breach.'"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about my feet, Wee One,
they're all right. I was thinking of Jimmy only;
I want to help him, not hurt him."</p>

<p>By the time the boys had finished their discussion
they had reached the entry.</p>

<p>"Do you know his room?" inquired Frank.</p>

<p>"Yes, second floor right," said the Wee One as
he began to climb. "Rooms with Hillard, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
you probably know. Hope Hillard isn't in. If
he is it will make it harder to get to the subject,
because Hillard would be displaced by Jimmy if
he were found good enough to make the team.
Here we are."</p>

<p>The Wee One's sturdy knock drew a loud response
from within: "Come in." It was Chip's
voice, and the tone did not sound pleasant.</p>

<p>Patterson pushed open the door and stalked
into the room, as brave as a lion. Frank followed
on his heels.</p>

<p>"Came to see you on a little business, Dixon,"
volunteered the Wee One, as he took a seat over
by the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Indeed! You came at a bad time. I'm trying
to get back work done."</p>

<p>"Sorry we disturb you, but it's important. This
is my friend, Frank Armstrong."</p>

<p>Chip nodded curtly. "Yes, I've seen him before.
He hasn't been here very long, has he?
Quite an infant, so to speak," and a sneer played
on his face.</p>

<p>"No, he hasn't been here very long, but he's
going to stay a long while, and may grow up to
quarterback of the School eleven or something
like that, or make something better," retorted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Wee One, who now that the battle was in sight
was rather enjoying the preliminary skirmishes.</p>

<p>"Well, what's your business?" said Chip,
roughly. "I don't want to appear rude, but I've
got a lot of work to do before I go to bed. Football
takes most all a fellow's time just about
now."</p>

<p>"It was about football that we came over to
see you," said Frank, speaking now for the first
time.</p>

<p>"Is that so? It's a little late to be going out
for the squad," said Dixon, "and, besides that,
I'm not the captain."</p>

<p>"I'm aware of that," retorted Frank, "and I'm
not going out for the squad this year. We are
interested in a fellow who is now on the squad."</p>

<p>"What do you think of Jimmy Turner, that
young Freshman who has been showing up so
well lately?" broke in the Wee One.</p>

<p>"He'll be good by-and-by, but he is punk now
on handling the ball. It was his fumble to-day
when we had a chance to score on Barrows that
upset the team."</p>

<p>"It wasn't his fumble, and you know that as
well as any one," and Freshman though he was,
Frank looked the quarterback of the eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
straight in the eye. That individual had started
back at the contradiction, but now recovered himself
and, shutting up his fist, he took a step in
Frank's direction.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you little pup? Didn't
Turner drop the ball? He could have scored
easily if he'd had the gumption to hang onto it."</p>

<p>"He dropped the ball all right, but he dropped
it because you didn't give him a chance to get
it," said Frank, his fighting blood mounting to
his cheeks.</p>

<p>For a moment it looked as if there was to be
a scrap right on the spot. At the first accusation
Chip rushed over to Frank with his eyes
blazing and fists clinched. Frank held his ground,
and he was reinforced in an instant by the Wee
One, who jumped the moment Chip made his
rush. Perhaps the consciousness that he was in
the wrong and that the accusation was true
withheld the blows that Chip appeared ready to
rain upon his visitor.</p>

<p>"Come on, Dixon, let's talk it over," said the
Wee One. "Put your bad temper in your pocket,
and we will get down to business."</p>

<p>"All right, go ahead, but I don't want any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to come to my room and tell me that I chucked
the game this afternoon."</p>

<p>"But supposing it was true."</p>

<p>Chip blazed out again. "I've a notion to chuck
you both out of the room by the way of the window."</p>

<p>"That's neither hospitable nor kind. What we
came here to find out is, are you willing to give
young Turner a fair chance to make the eleven
if he is good enough?" said the Wee One.</p>

<p>"What are you driving at, anyway? I'm
neither the captain nor the coach."</p>

<p>"Of course you are not, fortunately, but you're
the quarter, and as such you can make or break
a halfback that is trying for a place on the team.
At present your room-mate, Hillard, is playing
at right half, and, naturally, since he is a fraternity
brother of yours, you want him to stay
there. And you don't want any one else, even
though some one else might improve the eleven,
to win his place. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>Chip sat glowering at the speaker, but did not
answer.</p>

<p>"All right. There's an old saying I've seen
somewhere, and I guess it's true, that 'silence
gives consent.' You admit what I've said?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't admit anything of the kind," snapped
Chip. "Hillard is a better back than this fellow
Turner will ever be."</p>

<p>"Since," went on the Wee One, as cool as a
cucumber, and paying no attention to Chip's interruption,
"since you agreed that what I say is
true, I want to know if you will play square with
Turner. Goodness knows this eleven has been
messed up by you and your friends in Gamma
Tau pretty badly, and if there's the smallest little
bit of a chance to improve it, and let us have an
opportunity to pull out the Warwick game, you
ought to be willing for the sake of yourself, if
not for the school, to drop the favorites."</p>

<p>Chip was showing evidences of the greatest
difficulty to keep from bringing the matter then
and there to blows. He was opening and shutting
his hands and gritting his teeth. Finally he burst
forth:</p>

<p>"I don't know what you duffers are here for,
trying some kind of bullyragging on me. It's
you fellows who are playing favorites, not me.
Now I want you both to get out of this room and
stay out. I'll play just whoever I wish on that
eleven."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, so you are the captain, after all&mdash;I
thought you said you weren't."</p>

<p>Chip could have bitten his tongue out for the
admission, but it was too late now to change it,
and, having made the statement, he went on:
"I've got enough of a say to keep Turner on the
side line. He's only a Freshman," he said contemptuously.
"If he's good enough he can make
the team some other year. He can't make it this
one, not as long as I'm quarterback."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, Mr. Dixon, if that's the way
you feel about it there's no use in our staying
here and keeping you from getting that lesson,"
said the Wee One, "but getting it will be a waste
of time because you will not have a chance to
use it. We only wanted a promise from you to
let Turner alone, and not to hinder him in any
development he may make. Since you are not
willing, we have a little story for the Doctor in
the morning. If he hears it, you might as well
pack your pajamas, and buy your ticket for New
York. Good night, Mr. Dixon," said the Wee
One, making a sweeping bow. "Come on, Frank,
it's no use, the quarterback has a severe case of
astigmatism."</p>

<p>Frank rose and the two headed for the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
But Chip's curiosity was aroused. He followed
them to the entry. "May I ask what you have
that you think the Doctor will be interested to
hear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the Wee One, "we don't want
to take your time. It wouldn't help our case any.
We must be hurrying along."</p>

<p>"But I insist on knowing," said Chip, following
to the head of the stairs. "If you are going
to tell the Doctor something about me I have a
right to know. What is it?" Alarm began to
show in his bearing.</p>

<p>"Well, if you are dying to know about it, it is
just this. We have pretty good evidence that
you were one of the bunch that hazed Frank here,
the night he came to school."</p>

<p>Chip gave a sneering laugh. "Oh, that's it,
is it? I guess you won't be able to prove that.
And that's what you've been taking up my time
for? You are a pretty pair of young sleuths,
ha, ha, ha, ha!" Chip threw his head back and
laughed long and noisily.</p>

<p>The Wee One waited till Chip had laughed
himself out and then said, very quietly: "Well,
maybe we can't prove it, and perhaps we were
wasting your time and our own. Good night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Chip stood grinning as the boys took a couple
of steps down the stairs. Suddenly the Wee One
stopped, put his hand in his pocket, and pulled
out the leather wristlet. "Oh, by the way, Chip,
is this yours?" he asked, holding it up so that
Chip could see it plainly.</p>

<p>"Sure, it's mine," said Chip. "Where did you
find it&mdash;&mdash;" and there he stopped as a grin spread
over the faces of the two boys who were watching
him intently. "No, I guess it isn't, after all; it
looked like one I lost," he added, seeing that he
had made a slip.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure it is yours. There's a very
pretty little bunch of initials inside, and they look
remarkably like C. D. And how about this perfectly
good little strap?" holding up the strap
that Frank had picked up on the playground the
morning after the hazing. "This has the legend
'C. Dixon' printed very plainly on it. You make
very pretty letters, Chip. You will make a fortune
as a painter of window signs when you grow
up and finish your education." The Wee One's
tone was smooth, but irritating, and Chip was
ready to fight, but he saw at once that he was
powerless, and he knew very well what the Doctor's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
attitude would be. The proof was before
him.</p>

<p>"Come back into the room," he said, and when
they were inside the door, "What do you want
me to do?"</p>

<p>"All we want to have you do is to give Jimmy
Turner a fair chance. If he is good enough to
make the team we don't want you to put anything
in his way," said Frank. "In return for this we
agree to say nothing about the hazing."</p>

<p>"It's a bargain," said Chip. "Now give me the
straps."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no," said the Wee One, "we will return
those when the season is over. But for the
present I think I'll hang onto them, thank you.
Good night, Mr. Dixon." The Wee One put the
emphasis a little on the Mister. Chip did not answer,
but stood with his back towards them, looking
out of the window.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that will hold him for a while,"
said the Wee One as they left the building. "And
now it is up to young Freshman Turner himself."</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XI.</span><span class="subtit">A PROSPECTIVE PUPIL.</span></h2>



<p>The Monday following the interview between
Frank, the Wee One and Chip Dixon, found
things moving very much better down at football
practice. Horton turned up with a smiling face
at the gymnasium that afternoon while the squad
was dressing. "Boys," he said, "we are going to
let bygones be bygones. You've been playing
worse ball than you knew, and after that awful
game on Saturday I thought we might as well
all go over to the river and jump in. But that
isn't the way to win out."</p>

<p>One of the boys, lacing a refractory shoe,
grinned up at him. All had expected a heckling
and were not prepared for this.</p>

<p>"But that isn't the way," he continued. "This
is the last week we have, that is, the last week of
hard work before our Warwick game, for we
can't do much the next week which will count for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
anything. It will be just the polishing-off process.
So I'm going to ask you if you will give me your
whole attention. We are going out to make this
season a success in spite of the up-and-down game
we've been playing. Are you with me?"</p>

<p>There was a general murmur of agreement
among all the fellows, and a few spoke out. "We
will do our best, Mr. Horton," said big Boston
Wheeler. "The trouble is that we don't seem to
get together."</p>

<p>"That's just it," returned Horton, "you are
never thinking about the team; it seems to be
always about your individual selves, and no team
ever amounted to much that was simply eleven
men. The eleven men must work as one man
to make gains and stop gains by the other fellow.
When you work that way and have confidence in
yourselves individually as well as in yourselves
as a team, there's nothing can stop you. We
have a chance yet to win our big game, a fighting
chance if everyone will work with a will. Now,
that's all I've got to say, the rest of it is up to
you fellows."</p>

<p>It was with something a good deal like determination
that the squad tramped out onto the
gridiron that afternoon, and under the urgings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Horton, the First eleven gave the Second such
a pummelling as it had never before received.
Everything went with a rush. Jimmy was playing
on the Second and putting every ounce he
had into the work, but he was unable to stop the
charges of Dutton, who came through the line
like a bull.</p>

<p>Three times the First scored on the Second,
and twice held the Second safely inside the 10-yard
line. Horton was jubilant, and the practice
ended with hope high in every one's heart. Tuesday's
practice was even better, and the school,
which had fallen away from the support of the
eleven, began to take more than a listless interest
in the progress of things on the gridiron. Jimmy
was still on the Second, and taking most of the
punishment from big Dutton. Hillard seemed
to have taken on a new grip of the ball and was
playing faultlessly. Jimmy had had only one
chance at the position on the First, and while he
was in this position Chip had lived up to the
bargain.</p>

<p>"Wonder what's come over Dixon," said Jimmy
to Frank that night, "he gave me that ball to-day
as if it were the dearest possession he ever owned
and was afraid I might break it. He was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
careful he almost made it hard for me, but hard
in a different way from the day the Barrows put
it over us. No chance for a fumble there."</p>

<p>Frank and the Wee One exchanged winks.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess Chip has had a change of heart,"
said the latter. "Reformed, maybe."</p>

<p>"He certainly has reformed as far as I'm concerned.
I grew quite fond of him before the
practice was over, although I know he doesn't
like me."</p>

<p>"Whether he likes you or not makes no particular
difference as long as he gives that ball to you
right," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Oh, but his sweet disposition comes too late,
for I'll not get another chance. Hillard is playing
like a breeze, and he's certain to go in first. My
only chance is for him to break a leg or his neck
or something, then I might have a lick at it."</p>

<p>"But in the meantime you are learning the
game. I saw Horton speaking to you the other
day; what did he say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he told me to keep at it, I might make the
team in a year or two."</p>

<p>"Don't believe him," broke in Lewis. "Horton
was asking for a little bit of advice from my
room-mate." Lewis, since his retirement from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the onerous duties of holding down the sideline,
assumed the position of critic and cynic. "And
that makes me think," Lewis continued, "I saw
Horton talking to you the other day in the gymnasium,
Frank. Was he asking you for advice,
too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just telling me that I ought to come out
and get a little practice at the game myself. He
said he thought I was too light this year, but
that I might thicken up next year. He put me
through a course of sprouts on what I knew and
what I didn't know."</p>

<p>"Didn't take you long to tell him that latter
section, I suppose," ventured the loquacious
Lewis, "but please take warning from my case
and recognize that even the most gifted coach
sees only a small amount of the real talent."
Lewis threw out his chest.</p>

<p>"Frank, did they tell you how Lewis distinguished
himself the first day he was out?" said
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Well, that story ought not to be lost. Horton
picked up a couple of elevens the first afternoon
we were out, along about the end of the
first week of practice. He had been showing us
how to fall on the ball, which was where Lewis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
shone bright as the morning star. When the
ball got loose and Lewis fell on it, it never got
away, but it generally needed repairs, he fell
on it so earnestly, and you know Lewis isn't a
featherweight."</p>

<p>"This story is a chestnut, Frank," said Lewis.
"Jimmy got it out of a book somewhere and retails
it about me. He is giving himself more and
more to unbridled fiction."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Jimmy, going on without
seeming to notice the interruption from the hero
of the story, "Lewis was placed as a halfback
on one of these catch-as-catch-can teams. It
was an impressive sight to see Lewis trying to
run with that ball. About the time he had made
up his mind which way to dodge, some one had
him about the legs. Horton was good natured
then and only laughed. But there was one thing
that Lewis could do to the Queen's taste; as I
told you, he could fall on that ball, and once,
when it came popping out of the line, he dropped
on it and saved the day for his side."</p>

<p>"See him swell up at this part of the story,"
said Frank.</p>

<p>"That particular afternoon," went on Jimmy,
"in one of the scrimmages in which Lewis' team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
was on the defensive, one of the other backs came
up to the line, but owing to the mix-up of the
signals and a mix-up of players, some one lost
his head-gear, and it rolled out on the side that
Lewis was defending. He immediately fell on
it while the runner recovered, swept over him and
scored, and that was the last of Lewis as a real
football player. He looked impressive after that
coming onto the field, and I think once or twice
Horton let him carry the balls, but they were the
spare ones which were tied together with a
string."</p>

<p>Lewis took the chaffing good-naturedly. "But
wait until next year," he said. "I'm going out
again and I'll try for center. My weight and fine
build will strengthen up that weak spot I can tell
you."</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll all be on the team next year,"
said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"And then it will be a mess, sure," said Frank.</p>

<p>As the boys were still joking about the possibilities
of Lewis for center on the team of the
following year, there came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," yelled Lewis, "don't stop to knock."</p>

<p>It was a Western Union Telegraph messenger.</p>

<p>"A telegram for Frank Armstrong," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
"Went to your room at No. 18, and the fellow
over there said to pursue my diligent way thitherwards,
and ask for one Frank Armstrong who
might be in company of a fat boy with pink
cheeks," Jimmy snickered, "and a brick top."
It was now Lewis' turn to snicker.</p>

<p>Meantime Frank had taken the telegram and
had broken the seal. He read it with the greatest
surprise.</p>

<p>"Great Scott, fellows, listen to this:</p>

<p>"'New York, October 25. Frank Armstrong,
Queen's School, Milton. David has decided to
enter Queen's if possible. Will reach there
Thursday. Signed, J. B. Powers.'"</p>

<p>"Can't get along without you. Overpowering
magnetism and all that sort of thing," said
Lewis.</p>

<p>"It's fine, isn't it?" said Frank. "The school
is crowded, but if the Doctor has no objections I
can take him over in No. 18 with me. There's
barrels of room, and I'm sure Gleason wouldn't
mind. He's a good old encyclopedia. He's busy
just at present compiling records of the high jump
since 1852."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he go back to 1492," suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Lewis. "Columbus was quite a little jumper himself."</p>

<p>"And there was the cow that jumped over the
moon," said Jimmy; "tell him to get that record
sure. The old bovine put them all in the shade."</p>

<p>"Come and tell him yourself," cried Frank, at
the door. "I'm going over to see if we can't
squeeze another couch in my sleeping den. It's
not as big as the Grand Central, but if it can
be managed, David is sure going to be with me."</p>

<p>"If the room is too small, why not try a trundle
bed?" called out Lewis, but Frank was half way
down the stairs and did not hear him.</p>

<p>Frank burst into No. 18 where Gleason was
scratching away in his book of records. "Say,
Gleason, got any objection to having another
room-mate?"</p>

<p>"What, Web-foot, going to leave your old
wife?" said Gleason, looking up in surprise.</p>

<p>"I don't mean that. The fellow I was down
south with this summer has decided to come to
Queen's, if he can get in. I know the dormitories
are all crowded, and I'm willing to have him bunk
in with me. He's a dandy chap. You'd like him."</p>

<p>"No objections from the Codfish," announced
that individual. "We can set up a four-poster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
in the room here. It'll be very handy to hang our
clothes on. We need more room here anyway,"
and he looked around at the disarray of clothes
piled on chairs and tables and window seat.
"Bring him in, sir, the more the merrier. Always
room at the top," and Gleason returned to
his scratching.</p>

<p>"It will not be necessary to put him in here.
He can have half of my room," said Frank. "If
the Doctor has no objection, it's settled. I had
more room than I needed anyway."</p>

<p>"When's he coming?" inquired Gleason.</p>

<p>"The telegram I had says he's on the way and
will be here Thursday."</p>

<p>"Is he a Web-foot, too?"</p>

<p>"No, David hasn't any feet to speak of. He
walks with crutches and can't take part in athletics,
but he's about the finest little chap you
ever saw."</p>

<p>"Speaking of feet," said Gleason, "since you
are not doing anything in football, why don't
you go down to the track and do something
there? You are a likely looking athlete, and you
might be able to help old man Duffy win some
points for Queen's. He needs candidates for
every event. Nearly all the first string fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
graduated last year. Great chance for some
young buck to distinguish himself."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go down and show him some
speed yourself?"</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I'd rather watch. You see I don't
come of an athletic family. I'd rather set down
what the other fellow does. Got to be some one
to do that, you know."</p>

<p>The notion stuck in Frank's head. "I believe
I'll do it," he said half to himself. "To-morrow
I'll give myself up. I don't think anything will
come of it, but I'd like to do something to help
the school, and father has barred me out of football
this year, but says I'll be hardened up enough
if I stay out of it till next fall."</p>

<p>"You'll be hardened enough if you stay with
me," said the Codfish, and Frank dived into his
room, laughing.</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XII.</span><span class="subtit">A TRY-OUT ON THE TRACK.</span></h2>


<p>Track athletics at Queen's had not been in a
very flourishing condition for some years prior
to the opening of our story. The popular sports
were baseball and football, and these took the pick
of the fellows who had a desire to do some athletic
work. Patsy Duffy, the trainer of all the
teams, managed now and then to find some pretty
good men in the sprints and short distance runs,
and he had once sent a team of six down to the
Interscholastic games at New Haven, which
picked up eleven points in second and third places,
and that, when you consider that the school had
less than 200 boys to draw from, is not so bad as
it might be.</p>

<p>But although Queen's was never in any great
danger of winning the Interscholastics, the school
was nevertheless nearly always represented by
some one. Warwick was, in track athletics, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
in every other of the sports, the natural rival of
Queen's, and for the last two years had made
away with the annual track contest by a good,
wide margin of points. The trainer had gone
over the incoming class pretty thoroughly for
material and had not found much of it, so he was
pleased when Frank stepped up to him at the
track the next afternoon and said he would like
to try for a place on the team.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?" said Patsy.</p>

<p>"From the Milton High School, but I never
did much there in the way of athletics, excepting
to play a little baseball and football."</p>

<p>"Can you run or jump?"</p>

<p>"Don't think so."</p>

<p>"Can you sprint or hurdle?"</p>

<p>"Afraid not."</p>

<p>"Jump?"</p>

<p>"Can't even jump, to my knowledge. But I'm
willing to try any of them."</p>

<p>"Well, this doesn't sound promising, but some
of the best I've had knew nothing about it when
they came here, and I've sent some of the best
men they ever had to Yale and Harvard and
Princeton. Ever hear of Tinker Howe, the great
Yale half-miler? Yes; well, he was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
men I trained. Came out here one day and at
first couldn't run a half mile in three minutes.
But he came along fast. And there was Winchester,
the fellow who played tackle on Harvard
last year, and who was one of the best shot-putters
that ever went to Cambridge. He was
one of our fellows, trained right in this little
piece of ground."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I'll ever be like those fellows,
but I want to try anything you think I'm fitted
for."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you run up to the gymnasium
and get into some togs. Miggs, the rubber up
there, will fit you out and if you like the work,
and I like you, we'll fix you up with a regular
suit. Hurry it up, and I'll have you jog around
the track once or twice with Watkins here," indicating
a young fellow who was prancing up and
down the stretch with long, springy strides.</p>

<p>Frank was quickly equipped at the gymnasium
with a jersey and a pair of misfit running trousers
which Miggs had dug out somewhere for
him. "I feel like a scarecrow," thought Frank,
"but maybe after this performance to-day he
will not consider my efforts worth much."</p>

<p>"Come on now," said Patsy, as Frank came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
trotting back to the track. "Let's try a few
starts. You will run only fifteen steps or so.
Don't suppose you know anything about starting,
Armstrong?"</p>

<p>"No, I guess I don't."</p>

<p>"All right. On your marks, get set, GO."
Frank, accustomed to the starting signal for
swimming, went away like a shot and ran away
from the half-miler, who was taking things more
leisurely.</p>

<p>"I thought you said you didn't know anything
about starting," said Patsy, as he and Watkins
came back to where the trainer stood.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you that I have done a
little swimming racing, and we start about the
same."</p>

<p>"So much the better. Some very good runners
are spoiled because they can't start fast
enough. When the pistol goes off you'd think
they were going to take root. You don't seem to
be bothered that way, but I'm afraid you haven't
got stride enough for a long distance racer.
Try it again."</p>

<p>The boys lined up and started at the word
"Go," and again Frank started in excellent form;
but this time Watkins was watching for him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
got off his marks with more speed than before,
although, even then, Frank led him a step.</p>

<p>Patsy was smiling as they came back to him.
"Did you ever run a hundred yards, Armstrong?
No? Well, I'm going to try you at that now
and see what you can do. You have the appearance
of a sprinter, at least as far as the first
twenty yards go. Do you think you can hold it
at the pace you set out?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, but I'll try."</p>

<p>By this time a half dozen other runners, in
their airy, abbreviated costumes, who had been
trotting around the track or taking little dashing
spurts, had gathered around to see the new boy
tried out, and there was a good deal of interest
manifest when Patsy said he would have the new
boy try a hundred yards dash.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the Codfish strolled up.
"Hello, wifey," he said as he saw Frank in running
costume; "took my advice, didn't you? You
look handsome, but are you any good?"</p>

<p>"We are just going to try to find out," said
Patsy. "I'm going to run him a hundred yards.
Will you go up and start him? I want to take
his time. Here's a pistol. Collins, go along with
Armstrong and pace him down the full distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and bring him as fast as he can come." Collins
was the best sprinter of Queen's, as Frank afterward
learned.</p>

<p>At the sound of the pistol, Collins was off with
a great burst of speed, but Frank, in spite of his
lack of training, followed him closely for half
the distance. Then the training of the practised
sprinter began to tell and Frank dropped behind,
but not so far behind but that Patsy's face wore
a much pleased grin when he finished. Collins,
who was a Junior and slated for the captaincy
if Gamma Tau didn't undertake to knock things
out of gear with politics, came back and patted
him on the shoulder. "It was well run, Freshman,"
he said.</p>

<p>"What did he do it in?" said Gleason, coming
up to Patsy when Frank, who was not in the best
of condition for sprinting, was recovering his
wind. Patsy held up the watch. Eleven and
two-fifth seconds, it said.</p>

<p>"By Jove, that's good time for a kid, and his
first trial, and not in condition, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's first rate," said Patsy. "He will be a
good one or I miss my guess. He has a good
build for a sprinter."</p>

<p>Meantime Frank was taking a turn around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the back stretch, and when he came back, Patsy
said: "Armstrong, that's enough for to-day."
Frank was turning away when Patsy continued,
"Don't go yet, I want to have you try a jump
for me. We need a jumper badly, and you may
be the fellow we are looking for. You said you
never jumped?"</p>

<p>"No, only in fun, and the jumps were never
measured."</p>

<p>"Well, come over here and try one or two,
and we will see if you have any spring in your
legs. Most natural sprinters have."</p>

<p>"You see," said Patsy as they reached the
broad jump runway, "you get up your speed here
and then strike this take-off board with whichever
foot comes most convenient for you to jump from;
lift yourself into the air and strike in that soft
sawdust pit. The jump is measured from the
face of the take-off to the point where you break
the ground nearest to the take-off block. Do
you get me?"</p>

<p>Frank nodded and walked down the runway,
measuring carefully with his eye the distance he
had to go.</p>

<p>"All ready," shouted Patsy; "come on!"</p>

<p>Frank took a run, gathering momentum as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
came. He saw ahead of him the trainer and Codfish
Gleason and a dozen boys watching his
effort, and in spite of his best attempts he could
not concentrate his mind on that take-off block.
It seemed to lie somewhere in a fog, and he simply
kept on running with the result that he dashed
across it into the sawdust, which is put there to
break the fall of the jumpers, tried to stop, and
went headlong. He picked himself up, covered
with sawdust, and much chagrined at his failure.</p>

<p>"I want to try that over again," he said. "I
couldn't seem to see where that block was, and I
missed it."</p>

<p>Patsy grinned. "The best of them do that
sometimes. It's one of the hardest things in
jumping. As you come up to the block, you want
to concentrate your mind on that place. Arrange
your steps so you will come to it on the foot you
can best jump from, and come down on the block
as hard as you can, bouncing off it, so to speak,
and going as far up in the air as you can. The
momentum you have gained in your run will carry
you along. That's the idea of the broad jump.
And don't get nervous." Patsy communicated
this information to Frank as he walked along
with him to the head of the runway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"The take-off, the take-off, the take-off," was
drumming through Frank's mind as he came
rushing down for it. So determined was he not
to overrun the block that he under-did it this
time, and he "took-off" about 14 inches before he
reached the block. But even in spite of this
handicap, the measuring tape showed a jump of
15 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>"O, but," said Frank, "you are not measuring
from where I jumped."</p>

<p>"That's not the way we do it. We measure,
as I told you, from the face of the block, so that
as you jumped you really handicapped yourself
14 inches. It would have been a very good jump,
indeed, if that 14 inches hadn't been wasted.
The best jumpers contrive their run so as to hit
the center of the block squarely with the ball of
the jumping foot, the toe even projecting over
the block. Try it once more, and try not to
over or under-run the block, but to hit it
squarely."</p>

<p>"I never knew there was so much to jumping,"
said Frank, as he walked back for his third trial.
"But this time I'm going to get it if it takes a leg."</p>

<p>Fixing the block firmly in his mind as he had
been told, and also the idea of carrying as high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
as possible into the air, Frank came rushing down
the runway. This time he struck the take-off like
a veteran, rose in the air and was carried along
by his speed. As he was coming down he threw
his feet out in front of him so as to get as much
distance as possible, but when he struck he had
more distance than he could hold and fell backwards.
His heels had broken the ground at 16
feet 9&frac12; inches, but in his efforts to keep from
falling he had put his hand behind him, and
from the block to the break made by his hand
it was only a little over 15 feet.</p>

<p>Frank thought it hard lines not to get all he
had actually jumped, but saw at once that the rule
was right&mdash;that the first break in the ground
from the face of the take-off was the only right
thing to go by, although his actual jump had been
in this case two feet farther.</p>

<p>"That's all for to-day," said Patsy, "you've
had enough for the first day."</p>

<p>But Frank pleaded for one more try to see
if he could not get it right&mdash;the very last&mdash;and
Patsy relented.</p>

<p>And this time Frank did get it right. He came
carefully up to the block, got a good raise and
carry, and held his footing when he struck the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
ground. The tape measure, held by the Codfish
and Patsy, showed 16 feet 3 2-5 inches, a remarkable
jump, indeed, for an unpractised schoolboy.</p>

<p>"To-morrow at 2 o'clock I want to see you here,
and we'll do a little more work. Your showing
to-day is all right. Maybe I can make something
out of you," said Patsy, and when Frank had
trotted off in the direction of the gymnasium he
said to Gleason: "There's the right sort of a
chap. Doesn't know much about it, but willing
to try, and crazy to make good at whatever he
tries. I'll make something out of him, see if I
don't. The fall trials come off a week from
to-day, but I'll bet in spite of the short time he
has had to work, he'll make some of the older
ones hustle to keep ahead of him. I don't know
yet about his sprinting, but he certainly can jump
like a deer."</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XIII.</span><span class="subtit">LEARNING TO RUN THE HUNDRED.</span></h2>


<p>Frank was at the gymnasium at 2 o'clock the
next afternoon, garbed in a running rig that
the Codfish had given him.</p>

<p>"How did you come to have running clothes
with you?" asked Frank, surprised when the
Codfish produced from the recesses of his trunk
a neat blue jersey and a pair of spotless running
trousers.</p>

<p>"My fond papa said he thought I ought to take
some exercise when he sent me up here. He told
me he was a peach of a runner in his school days,
and talked so much about the way he walloped
every one in sight on the track that I got kind of
ambitious, and let mother put these things in."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go out for running yourself?
You ought to make a runner," and Frank gazed
admiringly at the long legs which Gleason had
spread out on the window seat, the lower parts
of them dressed in gorgeous green socks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I don't like to fatigue myself. If I run
I grow weary, and if I'm weary I must rest, and
I'd much rather rest without being weary first.
Don't feel backward about taking the duds, old
chappie, because your Uncle Dudley will never
put them on. If they had something like a 15-yard
dash I might get out and make a record or
two myself, but since the shortest distance is a
hundred yards and the longest is a mile, I guess
I'll put my spare time in some other way."</p>

<p>"And how about your father's ambitions for
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dad won't mind. I don't believe he was
much of a runner anyway. He just lets his imagination
carry him away."</p>

<p>So Frank became the possessor of a fine outfit,
and wore it that afternoon with considerable
pride. Patsy nodded pleasantly as he came onto
the track. "See you're on time," he said. "Now
jog around the track very easily two or three
times just to get limbered up, and then we will
have a few starts with Collins and you. Felt sore
this morning, did you?"</p>

<p>"Legs pained me when I woke up this morning.
Dreamed that I fell out of an aeroplane."</p>

<p>"It's the jumping," said Patsy. "I've known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
fellows when they began to jump to be so sore
they'd have to walk with a cane. But you'll
soon be over that."</p>

<p>"I sincerely trust so; it's no fun."</p>

<p>Patsy was like the manager of a three-ring
circus, as any track trainer, who knows what
he is there for and who is worth his salt, ought
to be. He had a word of caution to the long-distance
runner to run flat-footed and save himself
for the sprint, if sprint he must at the end of
his race; to the pole-vaulter he reiterated the oft-repeated
injunction that to get over the bar when
it was 10 feet up meant to pull up with the arms
and not altogether a spring from the legs; to
the hurdler he gave a minute of his valuable attention,
indicating where his take-off for the barrier
was too near or too far away, and if he lost
too much time in the flight.</p>

<p>"If you're going to hurdle on this track you've
got to get down to the track and run on it and
not try to sail through the air." And even when
he wasn't giving direct coaching, Patsy was
making mental notes for use later on when they
would be of more value to the coached.</p>

<p>Frank had jogged around several times when
Patsy hailed him on one of his trips, and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
"Now I want you and Collins and Herring"&mdash;that
was the other sprinter in the school, a second
string man to Collins&mdash;"to come up to the start of
the hundred. We will do a little work."</p>

<p>The little work consisted in getting down at
the starting line, balancing delicately on the balls
of the feet&mdash;the one just on the starting line and
the other about fourteen inches behind&mdash;with the
tips of the fingers resting lightly on the ground,
and at the sound of the pistol, shooting forward
from that position without the delay of a thousandth
part of an eye-wink.</p>

<p>On the first trial Frank made a sorry mess of
it. The crouching sprinter's start was new to
him. He had started the day before from a
straight standing position, but when he got to
the crouching attitude&mdash;pictures of which he had
seen many times, and as many times wondered
how runners could possibly start from such an
awkward position&mdash;he found it necessary to come
to an upright position before he could get under
way. Both Collins and Herring gained a stride
on him at the very start, and a stride is a lot in a
hundred yard race.</p>

<p>"See here, Armstrong," said Patsy. "The
sprinter, that is the fellow who runs the short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
distance, hasn't time to start off easy. From the
shot he must be moving forward. Now you
come straight up. Watch me," and Patsy
dropped down to the racing position, and shot
away from it with an astonishing swiftness that
made Frank open his eyes. Patsy in his time had
been one of the best runners, and knew to a nicety
just how to do the trick.</p>

<p>"Come on, now again, and remember that you
shoot out and not up," and Patsy held the pistol
over his head. "Get ready, set&mdash;&mdash;" but Frank
in his eagerness felt that the pistol shot was
coming, and dashed off only to recover in a
moment, and return shame-facedly to the mark.</p>

<p>"That would cost you a yard, Armstrong, if
it had been an actual race you were running.
But we'll not penalize you this time. Now
again."</p>

<p>Little by little Frank began to get the science
of starting. Patsy showed him the why and
wherefore of hole-digging so that the starter
would get a better grip with his feet. In a dozen
or more starts Frank showed improvement steadily,
and was overjoyed at the praise of the trainer.</p>

<p>"You are doing well, Armstrong," said Patsy;
"keep it up. Now take a little rest while I see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
what these high jumpers are doing. They look
from here as if they were playing leap-frog.
Those fellows never will learn to turn right when
they get in the air," and he hurried off to correct
some faults his keen eye had detected even from
that distance. While he was gone the boys
pranced around and took a couple of starts by
themselves.</p>

<p>"Have you run much?" inquired Herring, who
was a Junior and had worked hard for what he
got. He was not especially well built for sprinting,
being a little too stocky and short-legged,
but what he lacked in form he made up in determination.
He had almost reached his limit in development
and never could be a first-rater.</p>

<p>"No," said Frank, "I've never run before; this
is my first offence."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz, you'll soon have me lashed to the
mast. If you can hold the gait you strike at the
start clear through to the finish, I'll be third
string right off the reel. Here's Patsy back to
give us our trial on the hundred."</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said Patsy, "this is the last for
you to-day. I want you to run this hundred
through as fast as you can. Collins, you take the
pole; Herring, you next; and you, Armstrong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
have the outside. No crowding. And, Armstrong,
don't forget what I told you; don't lose
time getting up&mdash;the finish isn't up in the air, it's
down the track a hundred yards. On your marks!&mdash;&mdash;"
The three stepped into the little holes they
had dug for their feet. "Get set!&mdash;&mdash;" They
crouched and touched the tips of their fingers to
the ground, leaning well forward, necks craned
and eyes straight ahead.</p>

<p>"Bang!" went the pistol, and six legs and six
arms began to work like pistons. Frank had
somehow remembered his instructions and got a
better start even than Herring. He tore along
ahead of that runner who was making a desperate
effort to reach him. Collins was running freely
on the pole, a half stride in advance. For half
the distance the order remained the same, but
then Frank's lack of training and lack of experience
began to tell, and Herring reached him.
At the 80 yards he was running breast to breast
with Herring, but that individual's bandy but
powerful legs and better wind carried him ahead
from that point. Collins finished first, Herring
second, and Frank a good third.</p>

<p>"Well run," shouted a hearty voice from the
side of the course as the three runners pulled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
just beyond the finish line; and Frank, looking up,
saw Colonel Powers and David at the side of the
track. He ran over and shook hands, overjoyed
to see them. "Thought you weren't coming till
Thursday," said Frank, "and this is only
Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," returned the Colonel, "David
couldn't stand it any longer. We came up to
Milton last night intending to go down to Eagle
Island to-day to look after the house, but David
persuaded me to come out here instead, and so
here we are. But I didn't know you were a runner
as well as a swimmer."</p>

<p>"O, I'm a pretty poor apology for a runner.
Maybe I'll be able to run some day and win a
point for the school."</p>

<p>"Well, judging by the way you were coming
down the stretch with those two fellows, you
would be able to put the Powers family to shame,
eh, David?"</p>

<p>"Frank can do anything he undertakes as well
as the next one," said David, "and I think if he
starts out to run he can do it and win. Don't you
remember the race down at St. Augustine,
father?"</p>

<p>"Track work is over for the day," said Frank;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
"come along to the gym while I get into my
everyday clothes, and we'll go up to the room;
or, if you would like to, we'll go over and see the
football practice. David, you remember Jimmy,
don't you? Well, he is a candidate for halfback
on the school eleven, and in spite of his being a
Freshman, I think he'll make it."</p>

<p>"Jimmy was the owner of the <em>Foam</em> that sunk
in the foam, was he not?" inquired the Colonel.
"I remember how plucky he was when we picked
him out of the water. You all were, for that
matter."</p>

<p>"And Lewis Russell is here, too, in the same
class with us; they entered at the first of the
term, and I came in three weeks late."</p>

<p>"Is Lewis on the eleven, too?" inquired David.</p>

<p>"No; Lewis' football sun set very early in his
career, and now he sits on the bleachers the same
as I do, and watches the other fellows get talked
to by the coach.</p>

<p>"How does it come, David, that you changed
your mind about school? I thought you were
going to study with a tutor the same as last
year," said Frank.</p>

<p>"The trouble was," said Colonel Powers, "that
David, who has been a pretty quiet fellow all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
his life, got a taste of companionship this summer
on the yacht, and when he went back to his
tutor, old Mr. Melcher, he found the work drier
than ever. So he wanted to know if he couldn't
come along to Queen's with you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said David for himself. "Before I met
you I didn't think I'd go to school at all, but last
summer changed me somehow. I saw what a
good time Burton had, and when I thought of you
over here making lots of friends and taking part
in things, I wanted to come along."</p>

<p>"Yes, and it happens," said the Colonel, "that
Doctor Hobart is a personal friend of mine, and
it was easily arranged that David come
here, though it is nearly the end of October and
half the first term gone. The only difficulty about
it seems to be, for I have just had a talk with the
Doctor, in getting the right kind of a room for
him; they are crowded to the limit here."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you that the room part of
it is all arranged. He's going to bunk in with me.
The night I got your telegram I put it up to
Gleason, my room-mate, and he had no objections.
The place is not big, but plenty big enough for
us two."</p>

<p>David beamed with joy, and the Colonel expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
his pleasure that the boys were to be together
again. "David needs companionship to
bring him out of himself," he said, "and it is possible
that David may be a help to you, Frank."</p>

<p>That night the Colonel and David sat down
to table in the school dining hall together with
Frank and Jimmy and Lewis, and when dinner
was over they strolled under the great elms of
the school yard and listened to the Glee Club singing
on the steps of Russell Hall. To David it
was like fairy-land.</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XIV.</span><span class="subtit">A MYSTERIOUS APPEARANCE.</span></h2>


<p>David saw his first football practice the next
afternoon and enjoyed the spectacle of Jimmy
zipping through the line or spilling the fellow
with the ball when he happened to be playing
on the defensive. Dixon was living up to the
part of the contract forced upon him by Frank
and the Wee One, and made no further obstacle
for Jimmy when the coach occasionally put him
over in the backfield on the First eleven. But
Chip bore the Freshman halfback no very deep
affection. He was, however, becoming more and
more impressed with the belief that Jimmy was
the genuine material and that he was pretty nearly
necessary to the welfare of his eleven. Hillard
generally took precedence, that is, he went in at
first, but Jimmy would get in awhile toward the
end of practice.</p>

<p>During the week, practice had been very satisfactory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
by far the best of the season, and when
on Saturday the school eleven scored 12 to 4
against the Milldale High School eleven, hope
began to run high in the school that perhaps
after all Queen's might pull out that Warwick
game, which was now only a week off.</p>

<p>Friday night there was a mass-meeting under
the elms in the yard, and Horton, Mr. Parks and a
graduate of the school of some forty years before&mdash;a
Mr. Walbridge&mdash;were the speakers.
They stood on the steps of Russell and torches
lighted up the scene. There had been a torchlight
parade up and down the walks of the school, and
the procession finally halted in front of the wide
steps of Russell Hall where the speakers were in
readiness.</p>

<p>"We are going out next Saturday for a victory,
boys," said Horton. "We have been down
in the mouth all the season because factions have
been pulling us one way and another, but that is
all over now. You played good football this
afternoon, but you'll have to play better next
Saturday for those fellows up the river are going
to give you the battle of your lives. But if you
will forget all your disagreements and get together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and then stay together, we'll show them
yet."</p>

<p>"You bet we will," sang out a voice from the
rear, as Horton retired. "Three cheers for Horton."</p>

<p>Harding, the captain of the eleven, wakened
from his lethargy by the enthusiasm, jumped out
in front of the bunch of boys and cried: "Now a
long one for Mr. Horton, get into it," and they
did with a vim and a snap which made Horton's
eyes brighten.</p>

<p>"Rackety wow, rackety wow, rackety wow,
Horton, Horton, Horton."</p>

<p>The rumpus stirred the katydids in their leafy
bowers overhead and they were loudly affirming
and denying when Mr. Parks gave the boys a
word of encouragement. Mr. Parks was followed
by the elderly graduate of the school, who
told them of football when he was at Queen's.</p>

<p>"We hadn't a quarter of the number of boys
to choose from in my day," he said, "and I don't
think we were any bigger, but we worked together
and played together and ate together, and
when we went out on the field to play our games
we were so completely together that the team
moved like one man. And if you will look over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the records of those old days, you'll find that
Queen's didn't lose many games.</p>

<p>"It's the same on the football field as it is in
the daily walks of life. To be successful, I mean
to have the right kind of success, you've got to
play fair and hard and keep thinking. If some
one slams into you, I know the feeling is to retaliate,
for that's human nature; but when you're
tempted to do that, just think that while you're
slugging the fellow who slammed into you unnecessarily,
your opponent may be getting past
you, for you can't do two things at once. I remember
a fellow in my own class; they called him
'Biff Scott.' He used to play center, and when
he could keep his temper he was a wonder. But
a hard jolt always made him mad, and then he
was a very poor center. In our big game with
Warwick, for our big game was with Warwick
just the same as yours is now, the Warwick
center knew of Scott's weak point, so he teased
him into forgetting what he was there for, and
they put play after play right over him and actually
won the game because he fought and didn't
play.</p>

<p>"I'm of the opinion," the old graduate continued,
"that what Mr. Horton says is right, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
if you give up these little dissensions, get together
and stay together, you may yet make this football
season something to be proud of. I, for one,
believe you can and will do it. That's all."</p>

<p>Again the school yell ripped out sharply and
was echoed back by the walls of Warren just
across the way. Cheers were given for the team,
the coaches, the captain, and a crashing one for
Queen's School. Then the torches were swung
over shoulders again, and the procession took up
its course, the tramp of many feet following the
marching melody of the school&mdash;</p>

<p>When it was all over Frank and Jimmy and
Lewis climbed the stairs to No. 18 and found
David where they had left him.</p>

<p>"It was like fairy-land," cried David, as Jimmy
and Frank came in. "Looking down from here
it was like a long fire-snake twisting and turning
up and down the walks."</p>

<p>"How about the cheering?" asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"It sounded wonderful coming up through the
branches. I'm so glad I came up after all. I
had made up my mind not to go to school because
I felt I would be in the way," and he looked
down at his twisted and misshapen limbs, and
there was a tremor in his voice. "But just the
same, I'm glad I came. I can't take part in all
the fun, but it will be good to see it from the
window."</p>

<p>"Go along with you," said Frank, going over
to David and slipping his arm around his shoulder.
"In a little while you'll be taking your part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
just the same as any of us, and you won't have
to watch from the window as you say."</p>

<p>"What could I do?" wailed David.</p>

<p>"There are lots of things you can do. Maybe
you can write for the <em>Mirror</em>."</p>

<p>"That, we'd have you know, is the sparkling
weekly of Queen's," broke in Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Frank; "you might stamp your
name forever on the history of Queen's athletics
by writing a good football song, and who knows
but they might erect a monument to your memory,
because we're a little shy on good songs."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of trying myself," said
Lewis, "now that I've given football up for more
serious things."</p>

<p>"Because football's given you up, you mean,"
slung in Jimmy, "for better things!"</p>

<p>"But I can never do anything in athletics like
you fellows," said David wistfully. "It would be
such fun."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure you can't do any athletics,"
said Frank. "To-night I happened to meet Patsy,
he's our trainer, you know, and instructor in the
gym as well. I told him about you and he said
you might go into the gym, and if you develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
strength in your arms there are lots of things
you could do."</p>

<p>"What, for instance?" inquired David, brightening
up at the possibility of taking part in any
of the sports which he had thought all closed
to him forever.</p>

<p>"Well, Patsy said there was the gymnastic
work, parallel bars, horizontal bars, flying rings
and rope climbing. The champion of the school
gets a big 'Q' on a white sweater just the same as
the football fellows. And he said you might
make a good coxswain of the crew. Lots of
things for you to do, so cheer up."</p>

<p>"I'll see about it right away. I've always been
strong in my arms and hands, probably because
of these things," indicating the crutches. "You
see my poor legs are not very heavy," and he
caught the arms of the chair in which he was sitting,
and raised himself with the greatest of ease,
swinging his body clear of the seat and swaying
backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>"I say," said Jimmy, "wouldn't it be great if
David got his 'Q' before any of us?"</p>

<p>"Guess there's no real danger of my being burdened
with a 'Q' for a while," said David laughing.
"But I'll train up and be ready for it if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
'Q' should be flying around looking for some
pleasant place to nest."</p>

<p>"We're all looking that way and would be most
willing to offer a nest to this much-desired but
elusive letter. Jimmy is the most likely of us
if he doesn't break his neck before the Warwick
game," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Come on, Fatty," cried Jimmy, after the boys
had chatted for a half hour. "We must be going
to our model apartment up the road, and let
these old cronies get to bed. I've got to keep
good hours, you know."</p>

<p>"Speaking of beds, you see how I've fixed my
room," said Frank, leading the way to the chamber.
"We got them to put another couch in here
alongside of mine, right by the window. From here
we can look out and see you fellows laboring any
fine afternoon. The football field is right over
there," added Frank, pointing. He broke off
short. "Gee whiz," he cried suddenly, "what's
that?" The others crowded up close to the window
and looked in the direction indicated by
Frank's finger.</p>

<p>The moon was shining brightly, the stars
twinkled brilliantly, and the trees and the football
stands threw dense black shadows on the grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
which at that distance looked like a pall of black
velvet. But what caught and held their attention
was in the middle distance between themselves
and the silvery line of the river, where a
white shrouded figure moved rapidly along. It
looked like a woman dressed completely in white,
but the garments hung from the head rather than
from the shoulders, and seemed to flow out behind.</p>

<p>"It's a ghost," whispered Lewis, his scalp beginning
to stretch with the rising hairs. The boys
watched the thing intently. It did not seem to
walk but rather to glide along about five or six
feet from the ground. Suddenly it turned from
its course parallel to the river, and started to come
in the direction of the dormitory. It came on and
on until within perhaps a hundred yards of the
foot of the slightly higher ground on which the
dormitories were built, and then swung away off
in the direction of the football stands and disappeared
as suddenly as it had come, while they
stood watching with fascinated eyes.</p>

<p>Frank was the first to recover himself.</p>

<p>"Well, if that doesn't beat the Dutch," he said,
turning a puzzled face to his companions. Lewis
was positively blue with fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought the thing was coming right up the
bank," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, you grabbed me as if you had been a
drowning man and I had been a straw," said
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"You did some grabbing yourself," retorted
Lewis, beginning to recover himself now that the
apparition had gone.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll admit the blooming thing did startle
me, all right. Must have been a shadow," said
Frank. "The moon plays funny tricks with
shadows at night."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a shadow," remarked David, "because
I distinctly saw a black shadow following
the thing, whatever it was; and if it had been a
shadow it certainly wouldn't have cast a shadow,
would it?"</p>

<p>The boys stood at the window for half an hour
looking for another visitation of the spook or
ghost, or whatever it was, but the field appeared
to be deserted. There was only the moonlight on
the grass, the black shadows and the katydids
calling mournfully to each other the old, old
refrain. Then Lewis and Jimmy made their departure,
the former keeping very close to Jimmy
as they headed for their own room. Unconsciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
they quickened their steps and occasionally
looked fearfully over their shoulders,
and on reaching their entry made a break for
their room, three steps at a leap.</p>

<p>A little while after Jimmy and Lewis had made
their hasty exit to the other end of Warren Hall,
Gleason came sauntering up the stairs, and into
the room.</p>

<p>"This is our new room-mate, David Powers,"
said Frank. David and Gleason shook hands.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," said the Codfish. "Hope
you and Web-foot won't get lost in that big room
of yours&mdash;what's the matter with the both of
you?&mdash;you look as if you had seen a ghost."</p>

<p>"That's just what we did do."</p>

<p>"Get out, where?"</p>

<p>"Right down there on the meadow."</p>

<p>"Go to bed and have a little sleep, and you'll
get over it all right. You're studying too hard."</p>

<p>"I saw it too," chimed David. "There were
four of us and we saw it plain as day."</p>

<p>"What was it, the headless horseman or the
slaughtering ghost of the Barrows' football
team? Did it walk or skate?"</p>

<p>"No, we're telling you the straight goods on
this. Jimmy, Lewis, David and I saw it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
watched it for five minutes. It disappeared
down by the river bank. It didn't walk on the
ground at all, but seemed to be floating through
air."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow, poor fellow," said the Codfish
mournfully. "We'll get a doctor in the morning.
That algebra has gone to his brain."</p>

<p>"Well, you can believe it or not," said Frank.
"We saw it sure enough. It came apparently
from the river, and seemed to go back to it down
there by the football field."</p>

<p>"By Jove," said the Codfish, after a moment's
reflection. "One of the fellows at this school
was drowned in the river just a little below the
bath-house float three or four years ago, and they
recovered his body down there by the football
stand. I wonder&mdash;&mdash; I wish I'd been here."</p>

<p>And Frank and David and Jimmy and Lewis
also wondered, and the latter, when he was ready
for dreamland took a long, long look out onto the
silent playground. "Gee," he said to himself,
"and I thought of going down there to-night, it
looked so pretty in the moonlight. What do you
suppose it could have been?" He took the precaution
of closing the window tight that night,
leaving only those windows on the yard side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the rooms open. That night he dreamed that
a headless woman dressed all in white stood beside
his bed, and offered him her head which she
had tucked nicely away under her arm, and when
he looked at it more closely, he saw it was a
football and not a head at all.</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XV.</span><span class="subtit">FRANK WINS HONORS ON THE TRACK.</span></h2>


<p>David very quickly dropped into the school life,
just as Frank had done. The two room-mates
were always together. David was eager to see
everything, and every day found him, after the
school work was done, down at the track or the
gridiron. He also found time to get acquainted
with the muscle building apparatus in the gymnasium.
A certain small amount of gymnastic
work was required at Queen's, but David had
determined to take up some specialty. From
the nature of his infirmity those things which
could be done with the arms and body were, of
course, the only things open to him. Patsy's
assistant in the gymnasium, Harry Buehler, took
him under his wing, and set him at tasks which
would help to develop his arm and shoulder
muscles.</p>

<p>"Do you think there's any chance for me to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
anything for the school?" inquired David, shortly
after he began his work.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly there is. One of the best athletes
we had here three or four years ago was
a chap named Bascom. He had bad legs, but
the way he could handle himself on the horizontal
bar was a caution. He set the record here, too,
for rope-climbing. I don't think it will be broken
for some time to come."</p>

<p>David made a mental note that if he could develop,
he would take a whack at that record,
whatever it was. In the meantime he was content
to do the simple athletic tasks which were set
for him. Frank, who was not much for gymnastic
work, preferring the outdoor athletics,
came down to see David one day, and found that
youngster lying on the mat and raising dumbbells
at arm's length.</p>

<p>"Great Scott," he said, "where did you get all
that strength? I don't believe I could do that so
easily."</p>

<p>David grinned. "Perhaps the explanation is
that the strength I haven't got in my legs goes
to my arms. I can lift heavier ones than that.
Look," and he seized a 25-pound bell and swung
it up and down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank was amazed. "I didn't think you had
such strength. What will you be when you work
a while under Buehler? I'll certainly not get into
a fight with you. I'd have no chance at all."</p>

<p>"I guess we will not fight right away," returned
David. "But I say, you are in the track
games to-morrow, are you not? I noticed a bulletin
tacked up on the door giving the entries.
Does football stop the afternoon of the games? I
see some of the players' names there."</p>

<p>"Yes, they give the pigskin warriors a day off,
and some of them take part. The games are
chiefly to give Patsy a line on what there is in the
incoming class. In order to make it interesting
as a contest, every one takes part, the 'Q' men as
well as the new men."</p>

<p>"You're going to try the hundred and the
broad jump, I see."</p>

<p>"Yes, Patsy says I may be good at one or the
other if I live long enough. But I haven't much
hopes of myself. I'm too green."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you will make the best of them all,"
said David enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, David, no taffy here. It's bad
enough for a fellow who can do something to
have a swelled head, but when a fellow can't do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
anything at all, it's fatal. So don't try to puff
me. I won't stay and listen or I may get the
big-head microbe. See you later. Don't strain
yourself with those big weights. I'm responsible
to your dad for your well-being. Ta, ta."</p>

<p>At four o'clock the next afternoon there was
a sprinkling of Queen's boys, the non-athletic fellows,
down on the stands, to see what the new
class was likely to do for the school in the way of
track athletics. Queen's had been down in the
dumps in this particular line of sport for several
years, and it had become almost a habit to lose
to Warwick. There was always pretty good material
available for the weight events, but for
some singular reason no sprinters headed Queen's
way. It had become noised about that a new
sprinter in the person of Frank Armstrong had
been turned up by Patsy, and every one wanted
to see just how fast he was.</p>

<p>The first race to be run was the quarter in
which there were seven starters. Queen's track
was a quarter-mile, and the runners were to start
at the middle of the back stretch, and finish down
the straightaway. This gave them only one turn,
and it was supposed to be easier on that account.
Hillard was scratch man on this event. The new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
men were given various handicaps&mdash;that is, Patsy
set them at points from 10 to 20 yards further
along, so as to even up their speed with that of
Hillard, who had won the event the year before
from the best that Warwick had to offer.</p>

<p>"Nothing in that bunch," said a Senior as he
looked the fellows over; "they're not strong
enough. Look at that skinny Freshman with 20
yards handicap. I'll bet he'll die half way down
the stretch."</p>

<p>The little chap he referred to was a slender boy
of fourteen, light haired almost to whiteness,
and very spindly in his shanks. He had come
from some little town in the western part of the
state, and was so insignificant looking that no one
paid much attention to him in the fall practice.
Even Patsy's eye failed to note him. His name
was Brown&mdash;Tommy Brown.</p>

<p>After Patsy had put all his runners on their
marks, he gave the usual preparatory signal for
starting, and the pistol snapped. There was a
rush of spectators for the end of the straightaway
where the runners were to finish. Hillard,
sure of himself, and moving rapidly, soon began
to overhaul the inexperienced Freshmen. One
by one he passed them, and as he swung into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
straightaway with half the distance gone, only
two were ahead of him. One of these was the
fellow who had run second to Hillard the year
before, and the other was Brown, the skinny one.</p>

<p>"Look at that toothpick coming," rose a cry
from the watchers. He certainly was "coming"
like a locomotive, his thin legs flying and his arms
working like flails. A hundred yards from the
finish Hillard caught Peckham, but the little
whitehead was still legging it ten yards in front
of him. And now Hillard settled down to do his
best. Slowly he came up on Tommy Brown while
the school yelled its applause, but those thin,
flying shanks still continued to move with unbroken
rhythm, and despite Hillard's greatest efforts
he could not overhaul the Freshman who,
with a great burst of speed, broke the tape six
feet ahead of the champion. Immediately there
was a babel of voices.</p>

<p>"Hurray for Skinny!"</p>

<p>"New world-beater come to town."</p>

<p>"Hurray for the Freshman!"</p>

<p>"Hard luck, Hillard, old boy."</p>

<p>Patsy who had made a short cut from the start
of the quarter to the finish, and got there just in
time to see the Freshman's great effort, hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
after him on the way to the gymnasium, and whispered
a word of praise in his ear. Coming back
he displayed a stop watch whose hand pointed to
55 3-5 seconds.</p>

<p>"And that's going some for a kid," he said.
"I'll make something of him before he gets
through at Queen's." And Patsy kept his word,
for Tommy Brown not only won points for his
school, but when he went to college&mdash;&mdash; But
that's another story.</p>

<p>After the quarter mile came the half, but nothing
worth while turned up there. The event was
run in slow time, and the Freshmen who were
entered made a very poor showing.</p>

<p>Then came the first heat of the hundred yards
dash. Twelve runners were entered&mdash;among
them Frank Armstrong, who was drawn in the
first lot to be sent over the distance. As they
came from the gymnasium and trotted up to the
start, their good points were commented on by
the spectators.</p>

<p>"Armstrong looks like a runner," said one.
"He has a good step and a good face."</p>

<p>"I don't care about his face," said another of
the group, "if he has good legs and knows how
to use them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>David and Gleason were perched on the uppermost
row of the stand where they could see the
entire length of the hundred. David was all excitement.
"Do they all run together?" he asked
Gleason.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, they run it in heats or trials. It
wouldn't be fair to run them all at the same time
for they couldn't all get an even start. This track
will only accommodate six at one time. First,
second and third in each heat qualify for the
finals, so you see each runner has to go over the
distance twice."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"They're getting ready," announced Gleason.
"See them getting down on their toes. They're
off!"</p>

<p>A white puff of smoke came from the pistol in
Patsy's hand, and the sound of the explosion
came sharply to their ears. Away at the top of
the stretch they saw the runners spring forward.</p>

<p>Down the track they swept for thirty yards,
none having any advantage. Then the runner on
the pole and Frank began to forge to the front.
On they came, nip and tuck, until just near the
finish the fellow on the pole made a great effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and broke the tape four or five feet ahead of
Frank. The third man was a step behind Frank.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a pity he couldn't keep up," said
David mournfully.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you? He did exactly
right," said Gleason.</p>

<p>"How is that&mdash;he was beaten, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son," replied the Codfish, "he was
beaten for first place, but he qualified for the
final, and that's all you need. What was the use
of his running himself out? You see what an
effort the other fellow had to win, didn't you?
I told Frank myself to run easy in this first heat
even if he only came in third place. Third would
have been just as good as where he finished."</p>

<p>Then came the second trial of the hundred immediately
on the heels of the first. This was well
run, but slower, and it was won by the bandy-legged
Herring. A Freshman named King was
second, and Wilson, a Sophomore, third.</p>

<p>The mile followed and showed nothing promising,
no Freshmen getting nearer than fifth place.</p>

<p>"Didn't expect anything, anyway," said Patsy.
"A fellow has to learn to run the mile." But in
the hurdle trials Tommy Brown, the skinny
spindle-shanks, surprised everybody by galloping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
off with first place, beating out Morris, the
Junior hurdler. In the finals, however, Morris
got back at him and won, but the Freshman made
him stretch himself to the limit. Patsy was as
happy as a lark at finding such youngsters.</p>

<p>"This Freshman class has some good stuff in
it," he said, "the best that has come to Queen's
for many moons. Armstrong and Brown are
going to be corkers, you mark my words. Just
watch Armstrong in the hundred. For a kid who
has had no experience he is a wonder."</p>

<p>"All out for the finals of the hundred," cried
Patsy's assistant, who was helping to run off the
events. The summons brought out the six who
had been successful in the trials&mdash;Collins, Herring,
Armstrong, King, Wilson, and a Junior
named Howard. The latter two were not expected
to figure very heavily in the race.</p>

<p>"Collins and Herring will run scratch in this
race," said Patsy, who was getting the six ready
up at the start. "You two Freshmen go to that
six-foot handicap mark; Howard and Wilson,
you take an extra yard."</p>

<p>The boys went to their places, and there was a
false start, but on the next attempt they got
away splendidly. The first spring took Frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
ahead of King, and he never saw him again until
the race was over, but Collins, who had got a
magnificent start, had made up most of the distance
in the first thirty yards. Frank felt him
at his elbow, and determined not to let him pass
that point. On they flew. The spectators were
crowding out on the track and craning their
necks. Collins was running desperately for his
reputation as the best sprinter in the school was at
stake. He had come up on Frank inch by inch,
but every inch was hard won. The crowd was
close above them now and shouting:</p>

<p>"Collins!"</p>

<p>"Armstrong!"</p>

<p>"The Freshman's winning!"</p>

<p>"Gee, what a race!"</p>

<p>Inch by inch Collins gained till he was even
with Frank, but past him he could not get. Frank
was running with every ounce of power in his
body, and still held on. He could see the little
red line across his path at the finish now, and in
another instant he felt the touch of it on his
breast. But at the same instant Collins touched
it, too.</p>

<p>"A dead heat, a dead heat," shouted the crowd.
The boys had crossed the line exactly together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good, Freshman!"</p>

<p>"That's the boy, Armstrong."</p>

<p>And half a score of his own class surrounded
Frank and patted him on the back. The effort
had been so great that he could hardly stand, and
he was glad enough when Jimmy and Lewis took
him by the shoulders and let him rest some of his
weight on them, but he soon recovered a bit.
Herring, who was third, and Collins came up and
gave him a kindly word, and Patsy said when
Frank had started for the gym, "There is a game
kid, I tell you. When he knows how to run, as
I mean he shall, you will all take off your hats
to him. I guess we will have something to send
down to the Interscholastics in New Haven next
spring after all."</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XVI.</span><span class="subtit">WARWICK INVADES QUEEN'S.</span></h2>


<p>It was the morning of the closing football
game of the Queen's School schedule, Saturday,
November 12, and recitations were hurried the
least little bit. Even the teachers felt the excitement
of the day. This was shown by the generous
disposition to overlook poor lessons for at
least one morning of the school year, and some of
them even cut the hours short.</p>

<p>David, who had interviewed the Doctor and
taken his place with his class the first of the
week, felt the thrill of enthusiasm, and was burning
for the slow hours to drag along till 2 o'clock
when the great contest was to be called. Football
was literally in the air, for everywhere in the
school yard, where there was a chance for it between
the recitations, groups of boys were gathered
and footballs flew high from vigorous toes,
and there was the resounding thwack as the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
dropped in some fellow's arms thirty yards away
from the kicker.</p>

<p>It was an ideal day for the game&mdash;just a little
nip of frost in the air, the merest suggestion of
the coming winter, but this was tempered by a
bright, warm sun. It was not so warm that the
players would be exhausted by the heat, nor was
it so cold that spectators were put to the inconvenience
and discomfort of heavy wraps.</p>

<p>About noon the invading hosts of Warwick began
to reach the Queen's School, and spread
themselves about the grounds, flaunting the red
and black colors of Warwick. Here and there
groups of boys from the two schools gathered
together, and there was some little fraternizing,
but as a general thing the black and red and the
blue and gold did not mix well. The rivalry between
the two schools in everything was intense,
and the members of each thought the other school
just a little inferior in most things.</p>

<p>This feeling sometimes resulted in blows being
struck and blood shed from bruised noses when
encounters took place between representatives of
the two away from school grounds. But
to-day was the day of the year, and while rivalry
was strong, the feeling of antagonism was held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
check, for wasn't Queen's the host to-day, and
Warwick the guest? No blood should be shed
this day except on the fair field of battle&mdash;the
gridiron.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Jimmy?" said Frank to
that individual, whom he chanced to meet hurrying
along the path in front of Warren Hall.
"Have you seen that ghost again?"</p>

<p>"No, but I'm pretty nervous."</p>

<p>"Been losing sleep over the apparition?"</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks, no. The old ghost doesn't bother
me, but I just met Horton and he told me that
he may put me in before the game is over. I'm
scared to death."</p>

<p>"And what's to worry you about that? I
thought that's what you wanted most of anything
on this green, grassy earth."</p>

<p>"Well, I do, but what would happen if I didn't
make good?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry about that, you'll be Johnny
on the spot, I'm willing to bet. And if you get
in, you'll get your 'Q.' Just think of it&mdash;your
first year!"</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking of the 'Q' so much as
whether I can do what I've got to do. I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
just like I did that day when you and I swam
at the water carnival at Turner's Point last
summer&mdash;shaky all over."</p>

<p>Frank grinned as he recalled it.</p>

<p>"I remember that well enough. Before the
race came off I was sure that the moment I hit
the water I'd go down, and drown, but as soon
as I hit the water I thought no more about it.
And you will be like that. I tell you it's a big
honor to be able to get on the team the first year.
Not many Freshmen get the chance. I'm proud
to know you, Mr. James Turner."</p>

<p>"Quit your jollying, Frank, and tell me if you've
seen the ghost since. You never saw such a
scared kid as Lewis was that night, and you
couldn't get him down on the playgrounds after
eight o'clock if you were to pay him real money."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Frank, "David and I saw it night
before last in exactly the same place. It seemed
to come from nowhere and disappeared behind the
football stand. Seems as if it went into the water.
Isn't it queer?"</p>

<p>"It is mighty queer, indeed. What did Gleason
say about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he wasn't in at the time. He'd gone over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
to the library early in the evening, and David and
I were alone. When he came in and we told him
about it, he said it must surely be the ghost of the
drowned boy. He had inquired of old Peter
Flipp, the shoemaker up on the hill, and Peter
told him that the meadows were what he called
'hanted'."</p>

<p>"Did you see it clearly this time?"</p>

<p>"No, not so clearly as the first time; the moon,
you know, is on the wane now, and the grounds
were darker, but still light enough to show pretty
plainly. It was the same figure, and seemed to
move pretty swiftly, faster than a walk, I should
say, and slower than a run, and, as before, it was
above the ground."</p>

<p>"Well, it beats me," said Jimmy. "I've never
heard of anything like it. I must be getting
along. Here comes Gleason now. Good-bye, old
speed. I'll see you later," and Jimmy turned
away, as Gleason came up.</p>

<p>"Telling him what the score is going to be this
afternoon, old Web-foot?" inquired Gleason.</p>

<p>"No, Codfish, I was telling him about the second
visitation of that thing down on the grounds
by the river. When this football season is over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
I'm going to lay for that old ghost or whatever it
is."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't do that," said Gleason, "you
don't know what might happen. I've heard of
people who tried a hand with ghosts and their
hair turned white in a single night from sheer
fright. I wouldn't like to see my trusty wife in
such a condition as that."</p>

<p>"Just the same I'd like to take a closer look
at that thing, and I don't believe I'd be afraid;
but at present there is something else to be done,
and that's to get something to eat and get down
to the grounds in time for a good seat."</p>

<p>"Looks like a big crowd to-day. Guess these
Warwickers have all left their happy homes to see
the slaughter, and I'm afraid they're not going
to be disappointed," said Gleason.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't lose heart, you can't tell. There
may be a Freshman in the game before it's
through, and that will help a lot." Frank threw
this last word over his shoulder to Gleason as
he hurried to the dining-room. Coming from the
hall, after a hastily snatched bite, he overtook the
Wee One, and together they journeyed to the
gymnasium, where both teams were to dress for
the fray, Warwick having been given the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
locker room on the second floor, while Queen's
retained the lower floor.</p>

<p>As they approached the gymnasium a big coach
drove down the river road in a cloud of dust.
It was positively covered with boys. It bore the
football eleven of Warwick and its immediate
crowd of heelers. Wherever a boy could stick,
he had stuck himself, and every one swung the
colors of the school.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz, look at those mastodons," cried
Wee Willie as the Warwick players began to
uncoil themselves from various parts of the coach.
"They'll eat us alive. I know they must be cannibals.
Poor Queen's, poor Queen's."</p>

<p>"They certainly are whales," said Frank, "but
they look a bit logy to me. A good fast team
ought to keep them on the jump."</p>

<p>"Yes, but where do you see that good, fast
team? It doesn't live hereabouts, does it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't get discouraged so early in the
game. Wait at least till they've played a few
minutes."</p>

<p>By this time the coach had unloaded, and
the heelers of the eleven, reinforced by fifty or
more boys of those who had come down earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
in the day, got together and gave the snappy
school yell:</p>

<div class="spaced poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"War I wickety-kick,</div>
<div class="verse">War I wickety-kick,</div>
<div class="verse">Rah, rah, rah, WARWICK."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>"They yell as if it were all over, don't they?"
observed David, who had just come up.</p>

<p>"There does seem to be something of jubilance
in it, that's a fact," said the Wee One. "And the
eleven is certainly big enough to give the York
Freshmen a rub if weight amounts to anything.
Come on, we'd better get to our places, the stand
is filling up."</p>

<p>Every one around the country-side within a
radius of ten miles was present. Country lads
and lassies making a holiday of it; fond papas
and mammas to see Charlie or Freddie or Tommy
take his part in the game. And mamma was very
shivery about what might happen to the young
man in the conflict so soon to come. And then
there were the young beaux of both Warwick and
Queen's who had blossomed out into their very
best, each with a pretty little maid, perhaps from
as far away as Milton, at his side, who simply
revelled in the blue and gold or the red and black.
Some of the girls even carried the color scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
into their hats and clothing. And such a hum of
talk and such a clatter, as the crowds climbed
the wooden bleachers looking for the best
vantage points, and such a world of questions for
the young beaux to answer the pretty little
maidens.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," says one fair questioner, "what are
those white H's at each end of the field for?"</p>

<p>"White what?" says the escort.</p>

<p>"Those big wooden things like an H&mdash;two
straight pieces, and another across the middle;
it looks like an H. What does it stand for?"</p>

<p>"Stand for, stand for, why it stands to get
kicked at. It's the goal post, Minnie."</p>

<p>"O, stupid, I should have known. And those
little white lines. I suppose they're out if they
run across them."</p>

<p>"Of course they are," says the escort, busy
watching the corner of the field where the teams
make their appearance, and not comprehending
what she says.</p>

<p>But Frank, the Wee One, David and Gleason
have no attachments of any kind. Frank had
written an urgent letter to his father and mother
to come up, but Mrs. Armstrong was not very
well, and could not make the trip, and Mr. Armstrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
was too busy at the office. "Will come up
when you are on the team," was the answer.
And the quartet were all very well satisfied to
see the game this way.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a great waving of red and
black flags as the Warwick eleven came lumbering
onto the field with Captain Channing at their
head. A burst of cheering rolled up. The snappy
Warwick yell floated out over the field and then
a rollicking song.</p>

<p>In the middle of the song up rose the whole
Queen's side of the stand and let out a roar, for
the Queen's team was seen coming 'way down by
the far end. Their quick movements were in
sharp contrast to the heavier Warwicks. And as
the school saw their active prancing, a feeling
came from somewhere that after all the hard
knocks they might win to-day. The cheer leaders
were busy pumping melody out of the bunch
on the stands:</p>

<p>"What are you doing, whispering? Get into it
and let's hear you. It's as silent out here as the
town of Milton on a summer afternoon." This
brought a laugh, for Milton was not noted for its
activity at any time of the year. And they got
into the song which the cheer leader called for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Both teams were, meanwhile, going through a
brief practice in signal drill.</p>

<p>"My, how Channing boots that ball&mdash;see it
soar!" cried Frank, and soar it did. Channing
was a remarkable punter for a schoolboy, and
every kick he sent off was labelled danger for the
catching backs.</p>

<p>"Jimmy is not in the line-up," observed the
Wee One to Frank.</p>

<p>"No, didn't expect he would be at first, but I
think he'll get in, for I don't believe Hillard will
last long. He was never very good as a defensive
player anyway."</p>

<p>"Horton wants to put him in anyway at the
first of the game so as to get the best of his speed.
Good plan, too."</p>

<p>"Think it is a mistake," ventured the Codfish,
"because these fellows from up the river
are going to slam-bang that line of ours, and
they'll need all the defence they can get, and on
defense Turner is about twice as good as Hillard.
If I were coaching I'd put my best backs in and
try to stop these fellows' fire, and then when I
had them stopped I'd put in my fast fellows and
run around them."</p>

<p>"There's wisdom in what you say, Solomon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
but as you're not the coach, you can't give us
a demonstration, and Mr. Horton will."</p>

<p>By this time the teams had finished their signal
drill, and gathered each in a little knot while
the captains went out to midfield to toss the coin
for position on the field.</p>

<p>"There she goes," said the Wee One. "Bet
you Queen's gets it."</p>

<p>"You lose," said Gleason, "Warwick got it and
Channing's taking the wind at his back. Oh, my,
oh, my! That's bad, right off the bat."</p>

<p>The Warwick captain had elected to take the
wind, and the breeze now blowing would be a
considerable help to him. The sun affected
neither, as the football field lay nearly north and
south.</p>

<p>"There we go," cried Frank, as a piercing
whistle announced the beginning of hostilities.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>


<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XVII.</span><span class="subtit">THE GREAT FOOTBALL GAME.</span></h2>


<p>From the powerful toe of Mitchell, the right
guard on the Warwick eleven, the ball, which he
had carefully set at the center of the field, went
flying directly between the goal posts. It was a
wonderful kick, and a great yell rose from the
Warwick sympathizers, who believed that Warwick
had scored so soon.</p>

<p>"What are they shouting about?" said the
Codfish, contemptuously. "They'd better read
the rule book. It isn't a score."</p>

<p>"It went between the posts, fair and square,"
said David.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you can't score a goal from a kick-off,"
said Frank. "The ball will have to come
back,&mdash;there, you see the referee is bringing it
back to the center of the field. Mr. Mitchell
will have to do it over again."</p>

<p>"You're wrong again," said the Codfish. "It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
a touchback, and Queen's brings it out to the
25-yard line."</p>

<p>It was now Queen's time to cheer, and the
Warwick crowd, which had jumped excitedly to
its feet, sat down, the points they supposed they
had made having suddenly been taken away from
them, as they thought.</p>

<p>"It simply makes me sick the way some of the
people who attend football games show their ignorance
of the first principles of the game. They
couldn't tell an off-side play from a woolly dog.
Wow! there she goes," as the ball rose from
Queen's kick-out and carried on a long, slicing
drive away down towards the side of the field.
But Warwick punted on first down and sent
it once more into Queen's goal.</p>

<p>"That's going to be a hard one to get back,"
said the Wee One. "It doesn't give our fellows
much chance to dodge, it dropped so close to the
side lines. Hillard's got it, Hillard's got it!"</p>

<p>"Good boy, Hillard!" shouted every one, for
that individual, by twisting and squirming, had
carried it from Queen's 10-yard line diagonally
across the field to the 25-yard line, where he was
stopped from behind when a clear field was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
in sight. It was a pretty run, and brought the
ball out of danger for a little while.</p>

<p>There was great excitement in both stands as
the two teams lined up for the scrimmage. Frank
found himself holding onto the seat desperately
as the lines crouched, and his jaw was chattering.
He could see out of the corner of his eye the
tense look on the faces of the other fellows.</p>

<p>"Crash!" went the lines. There was a quick
pass from Chip to Dutton, and the latter went
into the line head first in what ought to have
been a hole but wasn't, for the tackle didn't make
it for him, and the result was that he got no
further than his tackle's heels, and was there
piled under a heap.</p>

<p>"Second down, ten yards to gain," shouted the
referee.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," cried Gleason. "They're as
solid as a rock. I wonder if Chip will try it again
before kicking."</p>

<p>They had not long to wait, for in another instant
Hillard was off for a run at left, and with
the ball securely tucked under his arm. Hillard
ran behind a good interference which kept him
from turning in, but when 20 yards had been
covered in a straight run across the field, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
left his interference, and took his chance on
an open space which had just offered. The quick
change of direction bothered him, he slipped and
fell, rolled head over heels for a yard or two,
and was pinned down to the earth by the big
Warwick halfback.</p>

<p>"Didn't make it, did he?"</p>

<p>"Guess not; they're going to measure." The
linesmen ran out with their chain while the two
teams gathered to watch the proceedings. Then
the men with the chain straightened up, and ran
back to the sidelines again while Queen's prepared
for a scrimmage, and the Warwick defence
backfield scampered backwards as hard as they
could go.</p>

<p>"Queen's ball and they are going to kick. Only
a little to gain, but they don't dare take the
chance. Good judgment, Mr. Dixon," said Frank.</p>

<p>"We'd put him in a mad-house if he did anything
else, particularly with those big farmers.
Twenty-five-yard line's too near your own roost
to monkey with fate," growled Gleason.</p>

<p>Wheeler got off a rattling good kick which carried
to the middle of the field, travelled high and
dropped straight. The Warwick back was deceived.
He expected it to go farther than it did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and was not under it when it came down. There
was a great mix-up, and when the dust cleared
away Captain Harding was found on the ball.
Queen's ball on the enemy's territory! How
Queen's did yell! Warwick's red and black flags
were as quiet as death now that the blue and gold
waved jubilantly.</p>

<p>"Well, if they do that every now and then
we may get one over on them. Come on now
and get into this, Queen's," shouted the Wee One.
He was all excitement, now that there seemed
to be a chance, and one listening to him would
think he was running the eleven from his position
on the stand. Frank was scarcely less excited,
but he kept control of his tongue.</p>

<p>Dutton slammed into centre for three yards,
and then in the same place made more than
enough for a first down. Again Chip drove him
at center, but this time the Warwick backs came
a little closer up and smothered Dutton when his
head went through the line.</p>

<p>"No gain that time, was there?" queried
Frank.</p>

<p>"No, the chump might have seen those backs
coming in a bit if he'd used his eyes. Wonder
if he thought they were going to keep on leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the door for him there at centre? What's
up, I wonder?" he added, for the Queen's team
had gathered around their captain, with their
heads together. "Some trick play they're going
to pull off. They'd better stick to the good old
bucking since it's going well."</p>

<p>But the critics upon the bleachers were deceived,&mdash;it
was not a trick play then, at any rate,
for the next play Chip sent against the enemy
was a delayed pass with Hillard taking the ball.
He had a big hole, and went for it fast, but somehow,
without any one being near him, he managed
to drop the ball. It struck the ground in
plain view of every one, but, providentially for
him, bounced up into his hands, and on he went
without the slightest check. The delay in making
the pass had unsettled the Warwickians, who expected
something entirely different, and before
they could recover Hillard had gone fifteen yards.
The Warwick quarter, who was the only player
between Hillard and a touchdown, threw him
hard. Queen's yells broke out afresh, and now
the Warwick cheering section began to get busy,
calling out in unison:</p>

<p>"Hold them, hold them, hold them!"</p>

<p>"Gee whiz! if Hillard doesn't stop those circus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
stunts," said the Wee One, "you might as well
send for the ambulance right away. I'll die of
heart failure. Did you ever see such luck that
he recovered it?"</p>

<p>"They ought to put tacks to his fingers, and
see if they couldn't get him to hold the ball that
way," grumbled Gleason.</p>

<p>"A basket would be better for him."</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't, he'd lose the basket."</p>

<p>The ball now lay about Warwick's 35-yard
line, and so far Queen's had all the best of the
battle, but it must be admitted that Queen's also
had had all the luck. But by good luck and some
skill the eleven had made good progress, and it
really began to appear as if they could hold the
big fellows from up the river. The hope in the
Queen's stand was doomed to quick disappointment,
for on the next play Dutton made a scant
yard just outside of tackle, and Boston Wheeler
could do no better than another yard through the
weak centre. It was third down and yards still
to go, so Dixon signalled a drop kick.</p>

<p>"It's all off now," groaned the Codfish, "we
haven't a drop kicker on the whole squad. More's
the pity."</p>

<p>"Well, let's all pray that he gets it over even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
if he kicks it with his knee. They're getting
ready. Steady now. Oh, Lord,&mdash;hurray, hurray,
it's over!"</p>

<p>The ball came straight and fast, and although
the Warwick players seemed to be surging all
around and over him, Boston Wheeler somehow
got it away, a most slovenly kick, but the ball
rose out of the ring of grasping arms, and went
in a wobbling fashion in the direction of the goal,
struck on the cross-bar and jumped over.</p>

<p>The Queen's cheering section was making the
place echo with its yell:</p>

<p>"Rah, rah, rah, Queen's! Rah, rah, rah,
Queen's!"</p>

<p>"Well, that helps some," said Frank. "Three
points are not to be sneered at, and they came
pretty easy, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, my, but what luck!" laughed the Codfish,
who had been pounding every one on the back.</p>

<p>"It will probably make those farmers come back
harder than ever, and it's early in the game, so
don't get too gay yet awhile. They haven't
been at it five minutes yet."</p>

<p>The Wee One was right. The score, so unexpected
for both sides, drove the big red and
black team to desperation, and after the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
kick-off, when the ball came into their possession
near midfield, they went at Queen's like wild men,
and tore their line to pieces. Wherever their
backs hit they made gaping holes, and carried
the ball five yards at a jump. Queen's fought
with great determination, and as the enemy
ploughed along they found it harder going as
they neared the Queen's goal line. Most of the
advance was made on Hillard's side of the line,
where the Warwick quarter found gains could
be made the easiest. He was not slow to take
advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<p>Finally the ball lay on the Queen's ten-yard
line. Warwick was confident, and crouched for
the trial, but something went wrong with the
signals, and there was a loss of a yard. Big Henderson,
the right half of the Warwick team,
who had a reputation for being able to bore
through anything short of a stone wall, was
called upon, and smashed through the Queen's
left side and made four of the necessary yards
before he was pulled down by main force. It
was third down and several yards to the goal
line.</p>

<p>"Will they try to carry it, do you think?" David
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guess they don't know themselves," answered
the Codfish, "they're talking it over. If I were
running the team I'd slam into the line again,
although it ought to be an easy drop kick for
Channing."</p>

<p>"They'll try to carry it, of course," cut in the
Wee One; "see, they're getting ready; Henderson's
going to take the ball, bet you a horse and
cart."</p>

<p>He was right. Henderson did take the ball.
He dove head first into the hole that was offered
for him, and tried to sidestep Dutton, who was
coming at him like a bull. He could not avoid
the tackle, however. Dutton knocked the pins
clean from under him, and he came down on his
elbow with so great a shock that the ball flew
from his arms, and bounded away toward the
goal line. Half a dozen forms dived for it, but
Harding, being fortunately near at the moment,
reached it first and hugged it to his breast.</p>

<p>It was a narrow escape, for when the two
teams lined up a moment later the ball was
placed on the ground only two feet away from
the Queen's goal, but it was Queen's ball. The
Queen's sympathizers breathed easier for a while.</p>

<p>Boston Wheeler had to go far behind his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
line to kick, and Channing, who was playing
back now for Warwick, received the ball from
Wheeler's punt on the Queen's 25-yard line. He
made no gain, as the two ends were on him almost
as soon as the ball touched his fingers.</p>

<p>Now Warwick began all over again, harder
than ever. It was two yards here, five in another
place, and in almost as short a time as it takes
to tell it, the ball was back in dangerous territory.
In spite of every effort that Queen's could put
forth, the big fullback, Channing, tore through
the last yards, with Henderson at his back, and
fell across the goal line just outside of the post.
And now it was the turn of the red and black
flags to wave, and the cheers which rent the air
had something of jubilance in them, because Warwick
had been able to cross the line, while Queen's
could only score by drop kicks, and, moreover,
Warwick was two points in the lead, but only
that, for the goal from touchdown failed. Her
sympathizers had good reason to cheer.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about it, Warwick is
stronger than we are, and only more luck like
we had at the beginning and then some more
luck, will save us," said the Wee One gloomily.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the period the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
raged up and down the field, Warwick always
the aggressor. Lack of concerted action was the
chief fault of Queen's, and the captain did not
seem to be able to pull his men together.</p>

<p>When the whistle blew to end the period, the
team walked off to the gymnasium to be freshened
up by their handlers. The score stood 3 to
5 against Queen's.</p>

<p>"Like Files on Parade, in Kipling's 'Danny
Deever,' 'I'm dreadin' wot I got to watch' this
next period," said the Wee One. "Danny Deever"
was his favorite verse and he was fond of
quoting it.</p>

<p>"Will Jimmy go in this second period, do you
think?" David inquired.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I hope so. I hope he gets
a chance, and certainly Hillard hasn't distinguished
himself to-day."</p>

<p>But when the teams came out for the second
period, Hillard and Dutton were still the backs.
Ends of the field having been changed again,
Warwick had the wind, which was now breezing
up considerably.</p>

<p>From the minute the whistle blew Warwick
became the aggressor and Queen's was constantly
on the defensive. Once or twice Queen's had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the ball and attempted to carry it, but there was
no unity in the play, and they were obliged to
give it up with a punt. But somehow they managed
to stave off the bigger team, helped along
considerably by the latter's blunders and fumbles.
The third period went in much the same
way and play had been going on for five minutes
of the last quarter when Warwick began to get
things running to suit them. Then they began
an irresistible advance. Twice Channing got
around Harding's end for a pretty run. The
Queen's captain seemed to be dazed. When he
began to go to pieces, his team followed him.</p>

<p>Warwick had advanced to the Queen's 15-yard
line and on the third down, having two yards to
go, prepared for a drop kick. But the preparation
was only a fake, for on a quick pass, Channing,
seeing his opportunity, made a long, sweeping
end run, cleared an outlying end, threw off
Chip, raced behind the goal, and touched the ball
down.</p>

<p>Of course, there was a great jubilation, for
the score was now 10 to 3, and when the goal
was kicked a few minutes later, still another
point was added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>As the team trudged back up the field to take
their positions for the next kick-off, Hillard was
seen walking wearily towards the sidelines.</p>

<p>"There's your friend the Turner, my old wifie,
going in," observed the Codfish. "Now things
will be different. Eh, what?"</p>

<p>"Too late, I'm afraid. Jimmy's good, but he
can't play the whole game." But Jimmy came
pretty near to playing the whole game, as Warwick
found out. Wherever they shot their backs
toward the line the Freshman was there to meet
the charge. He tackled everywhere, and when
he got his arms around a Warwick leg there
was no further advance just then. It was wonderful
to see that red shock of hair flying from
point to point, defending the weak places. Warwick
had penetrated Queen's territory half a
dozen times, only to be held up when they thought
they were about to score, and principally by
Jimmy's wonderful defensive work.</p>

<p>Finally, after one of these charges down the
field, it was Queen's ball on downs on her own
20-yard line. Time was passing rapidly, and
there seemed very little hope of any more scoring.
Warwick was pretty tired, and Queen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
was so badly disorganized that they couldn't make
anything go. In desperation Chip sent Dutton
against the line, but he was slammed back, and
Jimmy, without any one to help him, suffered the
same fate. Now he tried Jimmy at the Warwick
right end.</p>

<p>A new player had just gone in there, and
Chip figured that it might be good policy to
shoot a play at him before he got his bearings.
And it was good judgment. Jimmy got away like
a flash, Dutton acted as interference for a few
steps, but he was too logy, and Jimmy cut away
from his interference, bearing well out across the
field. The faster players of Warwick eleven followed
him out, and the slower ones, believing
he would be run out of bounds, did not follow
very hard. Consequently, a considerable gap was
left in the line of defensive.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash Jimmy dashed into the gap,
dodging and twisting as arms reached for him,
but he was through. Between him and the goal
was only the Warwick quarter away down the
field. Seeing Jimmy headed for him, the quarter
came up to meet him, confident that he would
stop him. Jimmy changed his direction a little,
and bore off for the sideline, so as to draw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
quarter in that direction. His trick was successful,
for the quarter edged over to that side, expecting
to run him out of bounds. Then when
the wide, unprotected field was upon Jimmy, he
swung to the left again, sidestepping the waiting
arms neatly.</p>

<p>Behind him thundered the whole of the Warwick
eleven, and he imagined he could feel their
hot breaths on his neck, and their hands on his
body. But he threw his last ounce of energy
into the business in hand, and ran on, holding
onto that ball like grim death. Now he was only
two chalk lines away, now one; a heavy body
struck him, knocking him off his legs, but he
struck the ground like a rubber ball, and rolled
over and over across the goal line with that precious
ball hugged tightly to his breast. It was a
touchdown.</p>

<p>Pandemonium reigned. Never had such a run
been seen on Queen's field, and it had been accomplished
by a Freshman.</p>

<p>"Turner, Turner!" yelled the crowd, and they
kept it up while the goal was being kicked. A
few minutes after the next kick-off, the whistle
blew ending the contest, and although Queen's
had lost, the crowd swept down from the stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and carried the embarrassed Jimmy, the cause
of all the racket, around and around the gridiron
on their shoulders. It was a great afternoon for
Freshman Turner, and the sting of defeat was
forgotten by the whole school in the performance
of one of its younger members.</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XVIII.</span><span class="subtit">GAMMA TAU RECEIVES A SHOCK.</span></h2>


<p>It was two weeks after the great game with
Warwick, and things in Queen's School had settled
down into their normal condition. The election
of the captain had taken place a few days
after the closing game, and the choice was on
Boston Wheeler, the fullback. The school did
not particularly like the choice, although Wheeler
was really a fair player, and had, while he was
a member of Gamma Tau, showed himself to be
a man of rather good judgment.</p>

<p>"He's the best of the bunch," announced the
Wee One, who had kept up the friendship with
Frank and his friends. The Wee One had just
now dropped into Frank's room to talk over the
situation.</p>

<p>"Do you think he'll make a good leader?" questioned
Frank.</p>

<p>"Yes, if he doesn't take too much advice from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Chip Dixon. It's a sure thing that as long as
Dixon is on the eleven he will work it for his
friends, and he will work Wheeler for his
friends."</p>

<p>"It's queer to me," said Frank, "that as bright
as he is about most things, he can't see where his
playing favorites hurts himself, and the team and
the school. Although Jimmy was better than Hillard,
he fought him off as long as he could. I
believe if Jimmy had been in that game all
through it the score would have been different.
What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think the score would have been smaller
for Warwick, but Jimmy alone couldn't have
stopped it. The trouble was with the captain. He
couldn't pull his men together when the test came.
They played good ball in spots, but they had it
in them to play it all the time. Gamma Tau is
responsible for the poor athletic showing here at
Queen's. And, speaking of Gamma Tau, have
you heard that they are pledging for the March
elections?"</p>

<p>"No, I hadn't heard. Are they?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I've been wondering if they've called
on you."</p>

<p>"Me? Gracious! You know that Chip Dixon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
would rather stick me than have me in Gamma
Tau," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, but he isn't all of the Society.
There are some good fellows in it, and they don't
take his view. What would you do if it were
offered to you, Frank?"</p>

<p>"I don't want it, and I wouldn't take an election."</p>

<p>"Yes, but Alpha Beta is the only other; you're
sure to get asked by their scouts. I wonder they
haven't been around yet."</p>

<p>"I don't want Alpha Beta either. I don't see
that it is necessary for me to be in a society, is
it? What good is Alpha, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's made up of the left-overs from
Gamma Tau, as I told you when you came here.
It hasn't any weight. It's the Gamma that is
the Colossus around whose legs we all crawl."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to crawl around Gamma Tau.
I don't like what it stands for, so I'm going to
stand for myself. I can get along without it."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear, fine sentiments from Mr. Frank
Armstrong. Hurray for high morality&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Wee One was interrupted by the opening
of Frank's door. Jimmy entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello," he said, "glad to see you. Hope I'm
not intruding."</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all. We were just talking about
Gamma Tau and her scouts who are out pledging
for the elections."</p>

<p>"Well, that's just what I came over here to talk
to Frank about."</p>

<p>"I'll be going then," said the Wee One, sliding
down from the window seat.</p>

<p>"No, don't," cried Jimmy. "You're just the
Solomon whose advice I need. You are bowed
down with the wisdom of the ages. Stay where
you are."</p>

<p>"I'm on my pedestal again," announced the
Wee One when he had climbed back to his commanding
position. "Fire away, and I'll pass judgment
with the help of the whole jury, Frank
Armstrong. Have they asked you to come into
the fold?"</p>

<p>"That's just it. Cuthbert, of the baseball team,
and another fellow I don't know, came around
half an hour ago and asked to see me alone.
They fired poor Lewis out of the room, locked
the door, and then began to ask me fool questions
about myself. I didn't know what they
were driving at, but after a while Cuthbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
stopped beating around the bush, and asked me
how I'd like to wear a Gamma Tau pin."</p>

<p>"And you said you'd rather have a rose," interjected
the Wee One.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. I just said I hadn't thought
about it. Apparently he had the notion that I
should have fallen head-over-heels into the plan.
I hadn't been thinking about any such possibility,
and I sat there like a dummy."</p>

<p>"And what happened? You are killing me
with impatience!"</p>

<p>"Well, they began to tell me some of the advantages
of belonging to it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And some of the disadvantages of not belonging,
eh?"</p>

<p>"No, they just hinted at those," said Jimmy,
smiling. "They said that I had made a good
showing in football&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No credit to them," snorted Frank.</p>

<p>"And that if I kept on there would be a good
chance for me to make the captaincy, if I came
into Gamma Tau."</p>

<p>"They emphasized the IF, I suppose?" inquired
the Wee One.</p>

<p>"Well, it was a little like that. They intimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
that with Gamma Tau behind me I could have
anything I wanted."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's exactly what they think. But maybe
there'll be a change some of these fine days."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jimmy, "I'm here for advice.
What do you think I ought to do?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know what to do?" said Frank.</p>

<p>"I think I do, but I don't want to make mistakes,
and I thought I'd like to talk it over with
some one. My own notion is that Gamma Tau
can go hang. I don't like the bunch that is in
Gamma Tau, and I don't like the way they are
running things in this school."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that another Freshman
has chucked down poor old Gamma Tau?" said
the Wee One, in what he pretended was an awe-struck
whisper. "Frank here, has just been firing
hot shot into them. It's a rebellion of the Freshman
class, that's what it is, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Quit your jollying, Patty," said Jimmy. "Before
Cuthbert and the other fellows got out of
my room I told them that I guessed I'd take a
chance on staying out, and if I couldn't make
good on merits I'd have to make bad. They
said not to make up my mind in a hurry, and
that they'd see me again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"A throw-down for the Gammas. Hurrah,
hurroo! But it's all off with you now. You have
digged your grave, as they say in Shakespeare;
it's your athletic grave. You're as good as dead
now. Go and buy a nice, sweet little headstone
and mark it: 'Sacred to the memory of the rising
athletic hopes of James Turner. Erected by the
Gamma Tau Society.'"</p>

<p>It seemed like a dread prophecy to both the
boys, who had come to the school hoping that
they might be able to do something for the school
besides their school work, something to help the
honor of the school on field or river, and silence
fell for a time on the gay talk. As they sat
there, steps were heard on the stairs.</p>

<p>"S-s-s-h!" whispered the Wee One. "I'll bet
a dollar it's the Gamma scouts come to have a
whack at Frank. Jimmy, you and I hide." They
sprang from their seats and scampered to Frank's
bedroom, where they drew the curtain, from behind
which they could hear everything that might
go on in the room. The Wee One's guess was
good, for the two were scarcely concealed when
the footsteps stopped at the door, and there was
a knock. Frank had snatched a book from the
table and placed himself in the attitude of study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in," he called.</p>

<p>The door opened and in walked the Gamma
scouts, Cuthbert and his friend.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Frank courteously, rising and
offering his visitors chairs.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" whispered the Wee
One to Jimmy, "They're after your young
friend."</p>

<p>"How do you like Queen's?" was Cuthbert's
first query. "Pretty good place, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I haven't been here very long," said Frank,
"but I think it's fine. If we only had some good
athletic teams here! Seems to be a dandy bunch
of fellows."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess it's one of the best schools in this
part of the country," said Cuthbert. "We are
not so big as Andover nor Hotchkiss nor Hill
School, but size isn't always the best thing. We
are closer together than these big schools, and
in a small school all the best fellows get together
easier." Cuthbert settled himself in his chair,
and threw back his coat, displaying the handsome
Gamma Tau pin on his waistcoat. It was a well-known
thing that a glimpse of the Gamma pin
had often settled the case of the doubting ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
when it flashed its radiant message to the candidate.</p>

<p>But it did not dazzle Frank the least little bit.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "we have everything here, I
guess, excepting good athletic teams." He said
it so innocently that Cuthbert, who looked up
quickly, did not know whether he was hinting
at Gamma's part in the "good" athletic teams
or not. At Frank's words the Wee One gave
Jimmy his elbow so hard behind the curtain that
that individual staggered and almost lost his
balance.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Cuthbert, settling back comfortably,
"we might have better teams, and we
are going to have them. Things have been breaking
badly for us for some time, but there are
good times ahead."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Frank, "we need better
times."</p>

<p>Again there was a scraping sound behind the
curtains, but Cuthbert, not noticing it, went on:
"You have a friend named Turner, who lives
in the other end of Warren, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He's one of my best friends."</p>

<p>"Well, we want him in Gamma Tau," said
Cuthbert, coming straight to the point. "He's a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
likely fellow, and we think will make good. In
fact, we'd like to have you both come into our
fraternity. The first elections are in March. It
is considered a very great honor to get a first
election. You play baseball, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a little."</p>

<p>"Pitcher, I hear."</p>

<p>"Yes, pretty poor, though."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right. You will improve. We
want you to be one of us, and to use your influence
with Turner. You will be both taken in together.
It doesn't often happen to Freshmen. I
didn't get my election till my second year, and
I thought I was pretty lucky then."</p>

<p>"And you want me to use my influence with
Turner?"</p>

<p>"Yes; neither of you know, perhaps, that
Gamma controls the school athletics, and it can
help a fellow a great deal with the honors of
athletics."</p>

<p>"Doesn't a fellow stand as good a chance outside
of Gamma as inside?"</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't say he did. Most of the athletes
are with us, and we run things about as
we wish them. May we have your word that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
will come along and bring Turner with you? It
is a distinct honor, you understand."</p>

<p>"I thank you very much for the honor," said
Frank, steadily, looking straight at Cuthbert, who
expected a favorable reply, "but I do not care to
accept an election. I think Turner has the same
opinion."</p>

<p>"But why?" said the amazed Cuthbert.</p>

<p>"According to all I hear, Gamma Tau has been
responsible for all the defeats in the school teams
for the last three or four years. As you said
yourself, you run things to suit yourselves and
elect your own captains. It doesn't strike me as
the right way to do it. They say a fellow who
isn't in Gamma Tau has no chance. If that's the
thing that decides it, I guess I'll stay outside."</p>

<p>Cuthbert rose to his feet as though he had sat
on a tack, and his friend followed suit. "You'll
be sorry for this night, my boy," said he, striding
to the door and jerking it open. "I can tell you
now that for Freshmen you and your friend
Turner have put yourselves in wrong, and if I
can help it you will not have another chance."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Frank, rising.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all," shouted Cuthbert, and out
they went, and banged the door after them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>The scouts were hardly off the stairs when the
Wee One and Jimmy burst forth, holding their
sides with laughter. "Hasn't he the nasty temper,
though!" cried the Wee One. "Now you're
both buried in the same grave. We'll erect a
double monument for Turner and you. Wow!
but Gamma will be hopping mad."</p>

<p>"Let them," said Frank. "I don't care a hooter.
If I can't get on a team without bootlicking that
crowd, I'll stay off it."</p>

<p>"Me, too," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"And me, too," said the Wee One, assuming a
dramatic attitude, and thumping his narrow
chest. "I wouldn't take the position of football
captain from the Gamma if they offered it to me."</p>

<p>At that moment a great clattering was heard
on the stairs&mdash;some one pounding up in undignified
haste.</p>

<p>"They're coming back to capture you," cried
the Wee One, "and take you to their lair by main
force. Skip." But before any one had time to
move, Lewis burst in at the door with his jaw
hanging and his eyes popping out of his head.</p>

<p>"The ghost!" he gasped, "the ghost! I was
out behind Warren on the bank a minute ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and it came walking straight for me, and I beat
it for here at a mile a minute."</p>

<p>The boys dashed for the windows which looked
out on the meadow and playgrounds. Sure
enough, there in the light of the half-moon went
the figure in white, sailing over the ground. They
all watched it with staring eyes, and while they
were looking it stopped, made a small circle, then
headed off down behind the football stands and
disappeared.</p>

<p>The boys watched till it had gone, and then
turned and looked at each other in amazement.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XIX.</span><span class="subtit">AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE MYSTERY.</span></h2>

<p>"Well, if that doesn't beat the Dutch," said
Frank, the first to recover his tongue after the
thing, whatever it was, had gone from their view.</p>

<p>"Seems to melt right into the air, doesn't it?"
exclaimed the Wee One. "I thought when I
heard of there being a ghost down on the field
that some one was just kidding. What do you
suppose it can be?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'd like to know," said Jimmy.
"The first time we saw it was the night David
came. We happened to be in the bedroom and
the thing came just like it did to-night, and then
went as quickly as it came. There's no kidding
about it. It's something, sure as shooting."</p>

<p>"Let's go and take a look," suggested Frank,
looking around the group.</p>

<p>"Not on your life," said Lewis. "I'm not out
hunting ghosts to-night. I've got something better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
to do. I've got lessons to get ready. And
you'd find nothing, anyway, and maybe the thing
would jump out on you. I've heard of such
things." And Lewis drew his coat tighter around
him and shuddered.</p>

<p>"Jimmy, will you come?" said Frank. "David
can stay here and keep watch to see if anything
else happens."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Me, too," said the Wee One. "I'm big
enough to keep you all out of trouble, and if any
ghost dare give me any of its lip"&mdash;he drew out
his chest and squared off at the imaginary assailant.</p>

<p>"Lewis, you can stay here with David if you
want to do your lessons, but be sure you shut the
window, for I've known of ungentlemanly ghosts
stepping right in through one if they happened
to find it open," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid, David?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said David. "Besides, I'm not
alone. Isn't Lewis here to take care of me if anything
should come? But I guess we'll be all
right. You are the only fellows that are likely
to get into danger."</p>

<p>The boys started off at once, and soon reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the field by way of the path down the hill.
They headed for a clump of trees by the boat-house,
near which they had first seen the Thing.
The crescent moon had dropped considerably, and
the light was dim enough, but they held bravely
on. Once Jimmy stepped on a twig of something,
which snapped under his foot, and the three boys
almost leaped into the air.</p>

<p>"Gee! how you scared me," said Frank.</p>

<p>"I'd have run if I hadn't been stuck to the
spot," said the Wee One. "Please watch out
where you step and don't do it again. My nerves
are bad, with all the hard work I've been through
this fall." They got another start as a night
bird whirred up from the branches of the big
elm nearby, but as Frank was determined to go
on, the other two would not leave him.</p>

<p>Presently they stood on the boat-house float
and peered all around. There was no sound
but the gurgle of the river as it flowed past,
dark and silent. A little white mist was rising
from the water, and the place was damp and
chill. Even the song of the frogs, which might
have lent a little cheerfulness to the place, was
hushed. They listened and looked, but they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
have been on a desert island in the middle of
the Pacific.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz, it's a melancholy looking place; let's
get back," said the Wee One. "Whatever the
thing is, it isn't here. I'd rather be up on the hill.
Let's go."</p>

<p>"Hold on there," said Frank. "I'm trying to
trace the course of the Thing. Down here we
can't see the dormitory lights, and I don't think
we can see them till we get through that bunch
of trees. Consequently we couldn't see anything
that was here if we were in our room."</p>

<p>"No, we couldn't, but what has that got to do
with it?" said the Wee One, impatiently. "We'll
get our deaths of cold here." But the shiver that
the Wee One gave was not entirely from the cold.
Now that he was on it, the mission that looked
like a lark from the comfortably lighted room in
the dormitory took on a different aspect.</p>

<p>Frank was already leaving the float, where
there seemed to be no sense in staying longer.
He climbed the path up the bank and went out
into the open field.</p>

<p>"There," he said, "you can see our light. It
was just here, I think, we saw the Thing the first
time, and it headed off down towards the football<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
stand, this way," and he turned his steps
down the river. Looking, he saw both the boys
standing a little way back. "Aren't you coming?"
he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use chasing the old thing? We
can do it in the morning as well," said the Wee
One. "It's too late to-night. Come on up to the
room. It was probably only a shadow, anyway."</p>

<p>"No, I'm going ahead, and if you fellows want
to go back, you may go back. I'm going to take
a look down by that football stand," and he turned
his face in that direction and stepped out briskly.
"They would think we were great ninnies if we
went back without doing what we started to do."</p>

<p>"Hold on, Frank, I'll come," said Jimmy. "I
don't want you trapesing around alone down
here."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I might as well go along, too,"
said the Wee One, who preferred the company
of the others, even on a ghost hunt, to traversing
the field all alone. So he, too, swung in behind
Jimmy, and the three went Indian file down along
the river path. They stepped carefully and looked
on each side of them. A couple of hundred yards
further along loomed the dark shadow of the
football stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's where I think it went, down behind
the stand. There's quite a high bank there, and
some bushes grow at the edge of the river," said
Frank, holding on his course. The others came
reluctantly along, not at all pleased with the adventure.
The football stand was just ahead, and
the shadow it cast was as black as velvet. The
space between the stand and the river looked like
a pocket, so dark was it, and the river itself murmured
along, singing a mournful tune at their
left.</p>

<p>"S-s-s&mdash;! what was that?" said Jimmy. "I
thought I heard a noise ahead." The three boys
came together, and grabbed each other. They
listened with all their ears.</p>

<p>"There's certainly something there," whispered
Frank, "and it's moving about, don't you hear
it? Come on, we'll see what it is;" but before he
could take a step ahead both Jimmy and the Wee
One grabbed him by the arms. But he shook
himself clear of them, and went stealthily ahead,
walking on tip-toe. There was nothing else left
for Frank's companions but to follow. They felt
their hair rising, and at every step they took they
glanced uneasily to right and left, as though in
deadly fear that something would spring from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the bushes, and grab them with wet and clammy
hands.</p>

<p>Again there was a sound as of something moving
in the darkness just ahead, and the boys drew
close together again and waited. They themselves
were in the shadow of the stand by this
time, and the noise came from a point apparently
only a few yards ahead. Suddenly the moon,
which had been behind a cloud, shone out faintly
and the boys could see something moving back
and forth about half way down the stand.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Frank, "we'll rush it."</p>

<p>"We will not do anything of the kind," said
the Wee One. "You can't tell what it might be."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go alone, then," said Frank, in a
whisper, "I'm going to find out what that is."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Jimmy, quietly. He
was not going to let his old chum take desperate
chances alone.</p>

<p>The boys, however, were saved the necessity
of "rushing it," for the noise began to grow
louder, and resolved itself into a definite step
which came in their direction. They squeezed
themselves back against the big uprights of the
stand and waited, hardly knowing what to expect.
In another moment the footsteps had come opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
to their hiding-place, and Frank closely followed
by Jimmy, sprang out into the path and
grappled with something. Down they went on
the ground, a general mix-up from which proceeded
groans and grunts. Finally Frank's voice
rose clear:</p>

<p>"I've got it, strike a match."</p>

<p>The Wee One struck a match with shaking
fingers, and when it blazed up it showed the
scared face of no other a person than Gleason&mdash;the
old Codfish!</p>

<p>"Holy Moses in the bulrushes!" said that individual,
"what do you mean by jumping on a fellow
that way, knocking him down and nearly
choking the daylights out of him?" gasped the
Codfish, as soon as he had gulped down enough
breath to fill his lungs.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged," said Frank, ruefully,
"I thought you were the ghost. Pardon me, old
man."</p>

<p>"Well, at first I thought you were the same
thing, but when we'd been scrapping around
here on the ground for about a minute I thought
you were the devil for sure and all. My, you
little rooster, I didn't know you had so much
strength. You nearly choked the life out of me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing down here, anyway?"
said Frank, suspiciously. "I thought you were
going over to the library."</p>

<p>"Well, I did go over to the library, but I've
heard a lot about there being a ghost down here,
and I came down to investigate it myself."</p>

<p>"And we were down on the same errand. It's a
good joke," and the boys had a good laugh there
together in the shade of the stand.</p>

<p>Together they retraced their steps to Warren
Hall, where they found David and Lewis holding
the fort at the window. Both were considerably
alarmed, for they had not expected the friends
to be out so late. The chapel bell had just tolled
the third quarter after nine o'clock. Lewis had
been suggesting the organization of a searching
party, believing that the apparition had turned
on the investigators and thrown them into the
river.</p>

<p>The whole story was gone over for the amusement
of Lewis and David, and they entered into
the general fun. Then they agreed that nothing
should be said of the adventure outside, because
it was too good a joke; but somehow it leaked
out, and was all around the school before noon
of the next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>The matter even spread to the Milton papers,
and that afternoon there was a half-column article
in the Milton <em>Record</em>, telling of the encounter
on Queen's field between Frank Armstrong
and the ghost which had been haunting the place
for some time. Frank was given great credit
for having the bravery to follow the thing, whatever
it might be.</p>

<p>Of course, that was enough to set the whole
school by the ears, and every night there were
watching parties, but the ghost did not make
its appearance again, at least while the watchers
were around. And gradually the excitement
about it died away. The officers of the school
did not take much stock in the stories, believing,
they said, that it was probably the beam from
some searchlight which reflected from some window
on the yard, and played fantastic tricks on
the eyes of the beholders. Frank and Jimmy
and the ones who had seen it the most frequently
knew it was not a mere shadow, but there was
nothing to do about it but to wait.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get it yet," Frank said to David.
"Ghost or no ghost, I'm going to chase it down."</p>

<p>"It may never appear again," said David.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it will. We haven't seen the last of
it."</p>

<p>Gleason, who was at his desk, was listening
to the conversation. "What do you think about
it, Gleason?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not much of a judge of such things,
but I suppose it will show its nose some time again
and scare us all out of our boots when we least
expect it. I wouldn't wonder if we had an appearance
soon, it's about time."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, I just feel that way."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Frank, "I'm too busy with
my work just now to chase it, but it better look
out."</p>

<p>"Better let it alone, it may hurt you."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so? I thought you
said you were no judge of ghosts a minute ago!"</p>

<p>"Well, all I know is that I'm not going hunting
it again. Once was enough."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said that night, but the
next night, shortly after the early dusk had fallen,
Gleason, who had been bending over his studies
at the table, got up, stretched himself, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I'll go over to the library a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
while. I'll be back in an hour or so." He went
out and shut the door behind him.</p>

<p>He was no sooner out of sight than Frank
slammed his book down on the desk, startling
David.</p>

<p>"I have a notion there's going to be an appearance
to-night. Something in my bones tells me
there is something on foot, and the ghost is
going to walk, or glide, or fly, or something.
And, by the hocus pocus, I'm going to find out
which means of locomotion it uses, and whether
it is vapor or blood and bones."</p>

<p>"How, I'd like to know?" inquired David.</p>

<p>"See this perfectly fine piece of cord? Well,
it's about a hundred feet long, a nice hempen
cord, big enough for ghost or man to hang himself
on. Now, I'm going to tie one end of this
to that big oak tree down on the bank, and the
other end to a stake at the corner of the gymnasium.
Whatever the blooming thing is, it will
have to go past that string. It seems to float
right through the air, and if it really does that
then I'll have to guess again. But I have a notion
it doesn't float, and if it walks, there's going
to be a tumble for it, for this nice little piece of
cord will be four or five feet off the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shoot up and get Jimmy and Lewis,"
Frank continued, "and I'll shoot down and hitch
up my trap. Have them come to the bank right
under our window, and we'll wait there and see
what happens." Frank was off with a rush to
do his part of the work, and David started on
his errand. In ten or fifteen minutes Frank
had accomplished his purpose, and was back, waiting
at the bank behind Warren Hall, alongside
the trunk of a big oak, protected from the cold
of the late November night by a thick sweater
and heavy cap. He was joined there a few minutes
later by the three boys and the Wee One;
for on the way over they had run across the
latter and brought him along.</p>

<p>When the new arrivals came to the meeting-place,
the Wee One wanted to know what it was
all about. Frank gave a whispered account of
what he had done.</p>

<p>"Yes, but what gives you the notion that the
great scene from Macbeth is coming off to-night?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, I just feel that it is, and I wanted
you fellows to see it. All we have to do is to
watch here and keep out of sight."</p>

<p>"If you expect us to watch here long with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
you," said the Wee One, "you should have provided
a gas stove or something. It's blithering
cold." The boys huddled up close together, and
waited while the minutes passed without anything
happening.</p>

<p>"My opinion of it is, that you're a bum guesser.
Get us out of our cosey corners just to see how
wrong you could be," grumbled the Wee One.</p>

<p>"Keep your nerve, Big Fellow," retorted
Frank. "'Everything comes to him who waits,' so
the copybook of my fast vanishing childhood told
me. The night is only begun. I say, Lewis,
will you run over and look in the library and see
if the Codfish is there?"</p>

<p>"Run over yourself," suggested Lewis.</p>

<p>"'Fraid cat. I can't go," said Frank. "I'm
stage manager of this act, and I can't leave the
job."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said the Wee One. "It will keep
me from freezing," and he dashed off. He was
back in a few minutes, and reported that Gleason
had been there, but had gone a few minutes before.
One of the fellows who knew Gleason
was positive that he had gone out, probably to
his room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why did you want to know?" added the messenger.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't want him messing around here.
He'd think we were crazy, sitting out here on
the cold ground, waiting for a spirit to make its
appearance."</p>

<p>"Well, if it doesn't indicate its presence in
about three shakes of a lamb's tail, I, for one,
will be after wishing you a hearty good ni&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused in the middle of his sentence and
pointed. There over the clump of trees near the
boat-house rose the Thing. It seemed to come
right out of the trees, and headed across the field
in the direction of Warren, just as it had done
before. The boys watched it with bated breath,
as it approached them. Lewis, who had been a
little way down the bank, now hastily got to his
feet and went to the rear of the group, ready
to make a flying retreat if necessary, but meanwhile
keeping the others in front of him as a
measure of present safety. On the Thing came
till it was within a hundred yards or so of where
they were hidden, then it stopped and appeared
to go backwards in the direction of the football
stand and the river.</p>

<p>No one moved. They sat watching, expecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
every moment that it would disappear as it had
in the past. And it did disappear, but not just
in that way. All of a sudden the sound of a yell
floated up to the ears of the watchers. The white
thing took a curious circular motion in the moonlight
and sank to the ground; but it did not disappear,
instead it seemed to flop around and then
lay quiet.</p>

<p>"Come on, fellows," yelled Frank. "David, you
stay here," and he started to run in the direction
of the ghost as fast as his legs would carry him.
Jimmy and the Wee One followed him. In a
minute or two they were up to the ghost. There
seemed to be two of it, one white and the other
black. The white thing lay in a heap on the grass
and the black thing rolled around in agony.</p>

<p>"O Lord, I'm killed, I'm killed. My arms and
my legs are all broken."</p>

<p>"Great Scott! it's the Codfish!" cried Jimmy.
"Here, help him. He's hurt."</p>

<p>The three boys got on their knees beside the
repentant ghost.</p>

<p>"I was just doing it for fun," he said. "I
learned to walk on stilts this summer. Oh, my
arms! and I thought it would be a good joke to
start a scare in the school&mdash;so I got a sheet&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
wrapped it around me down there in the woods&mdash;and
then walked around here and&mdash;down behind
the football stand, where I hid the stilts&mdash;Oh,
I know I'm going to die!" This confession
came out in gasps, for the fall over Frank's cord,
hampered as the "ghost" had been by the entangling
sheet, had been a severe one. But, fortunately,
it had broken no bones, and the worst
damage it had done the Codfish was to knock
all the wind out of his body.</p>

<p>He was a very humble ghost as the investigators
helped him up to his room that night.</p>

<p>"But for heaven's sake don't tell any one about
it. I'd never hear the last of it," he begged.
But like the other joke on the Codfish, the
story somehow got out and the "ghost" was
guyed about his tumble for the rest of his school
course.</p>

<p>And the next day the Milton <em>Record</em> had another
story of how Frank Armstrong trapped
the mystery of Queen's School. It was the sensation
of the year.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XX.</span><span class="subtit">A CONTEST AT THE GYMNASIUM.</span></h2>


<p>With the laying of the ghost, excitement
dropped temporarily from the life of Queen's
School. It was the time for work now, and right
valiantly did every one study, making up for
some of the lost time in the glorious fall days
which invited one out in the open to waste the
hours. Examinations were coming along, and
the evenings were put in poring over the books.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong was a visitor at the school
for a day at this time, and Frank conducted her
around the grounds, to the boat-house, the football
field, the baseball field and the gymnasium.
She wanted to know where they had trapped
the ghost, and he showed her. It was a happy
day for Frank, who pointed out the various things
of interest around the old school as if they belonged
to him personally.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong noted the look of health on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
her boy's face, and was glad. She felt that he
had already gained something physically, for
even in the short time he had been at the school
he seemed to have increased in stature. She told
Frank that he was growing like a weed.</p>

<p>"You think I'm growing. Just cast your eye
on Jimmy," said Frank. "Jimmy grew bigger
every day of football and he is as hard as a stone
wall. Feel his muscles. Come on, Jimmy, show
the lady." And Jimmy obligingly flexed his biceps
and offered the bunched-up knot of muscles
as a proof of his growing power.</p>

<p>"And look at David there. He's going to be
the champion strong man of Queen's, if he doesn't
look out. He spends all his spare time down at
the gym. You should see him dipping on the
parallel bars and doing stunts on the flying rings.
Patsy has to actually drive him out of the place,"
which was a fact. "David has made up his mind
to be a 'champeen.'"</p>

<p>"I can't do anything else, Mrs. Armstrong,"
said David. "And I've got so much to learn that
I have to keep at it."</p>

<p>David had set his heart on winning a place
on the gymnasium team, and to do this he had
taken up the work he was best fitted for. Owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
to his light body and a natural strength in his
arms, he was already able to do things in raising
himself with his arms, which a boy fully developed,
of greater general strength, might have
accomplished only with the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>David's strength of arm was in evidence one
day at the gymnasium when the four friends,
David, Frank, Jimmy and Lewis, were on the
floor. A certain amount of physical work in
the gym was called for by the school requirements,
or, at least, a certain time had to be spent
in some kind of exercise. Boys who took part
in any of the outdoor sports were not called
upon to do work on the floor during the period
of practice of the teams they represented. To
Lewis, who was indolent of body, the hour in
the gym was the hardest of the day, but he made
his task as light as it could be. His way of exercise
was to stroll over to a chest-weight and give
it two or three pulls with the lightest loads he
could find for it, and then walk to the other end
of the gym for two or three pulls at some other
piece of apparatus. Patsy kept after him, but
athletic work for Lewis was like pulling teeth.</p>

<p>On the day in question, the four boys had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
about finished their work and stopped by the end
of the parallel bars.</p>

<p>"How many times can you dip?" said Jimmy.
Dipping, as of course every one knows, consists
in raising oneself up and down from a bent position
of the arms to a straight position, the
weight of the body being carried entirely on the
arms during the raise and drop.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Frank, "never tried."</p>

<p>"Go on and show your speed," said Jimmy, "it
will be good practice for your pitching arm. All
good pitchers have lots of muscle, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, go ahead," said David, "we'll all try."</p>

<p>Frank, thus urged, swung up on the end of the
bars. "Count for me," he said, as he let himself
down between the bars and straightened up; "I'll
need all the wind I've got."</p>

<p>Jimmy began, "One, two, three, four, five, six,
good boy, keep a-going&mdash;seven, eight,&mdash;getting
pretty heavy, eh? Nine, ten&mdash;eleven, twelve&mdash;going,
going, gone;&mdash;no, he has one more in him,&mdash;thirteen&mdash;don't
stop there, it's unlucky." But
Frank had stuck. He got down all right on the
fourteenth dip, but could not straighten up. He
dropped off, puffing. "Gee, that's work," he said,
"Go ahead, you try," indicating Jimmy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said that individual, "I want to see Lewis
try it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not feeling very strong to-day," said
Lewis, "I'll do it some other day."</p>

<p>"Here, here, no shystering," said all hands.
"We all agreed to do it. Take your turn."</p>

<p>So Lewis reluctantly struggled to a position
on the bars. "I'll count," said Frank. Lewis let
himself down gingerly, and there he hung. He
was heavy and fat. He made desperate efforts
to push himself up again, and struggled and
kicked, but although he got part of the way up,
he couldn't straighten those arms, although the
blood was almost bursting out of his cheeks in
the effort. The boys were howling with laughter.</p>

<p>"Kick with your left leg."</p>

<p>"Hold your mouth straight, and you'll make it."</p>

<p>"Get a step ladder."</p>

<p>"Give him a push."</p>

<p>"Get an elevator."</p>

<p>These and other suggestions the tormentors
offered Lewis as he hung there struggling. Finally,
in despair, he let go and dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>The boys were screaming with laughter, and
Lewis was not any too well pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good work, Lewis, you did it just half a time.
That's a record."</p>

<p>"Try it yourself," said Lewis, "I told you I
didn't feel very strong this afternoon. I've got
a lame wrist, anyway." Lewis always had an
excuse.</p>

<p>It was Jimmy's turn and he mounted the bars.
Frank counted, and Jimmy, who was remarkably
strong for his years, being a sound and sturdy
youngster, dipped down and swung back again
no less than nineteen times before he gave it up.</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Frank, "that beats me. I guess
you're it."</p>

<p>"No," said Jimmy. "David hasn't tried yet."</p>

<p>"I guess I can't dip that many times," said
David, preparing for his trial. "Patsy says it's
one of the hardest things to do and shows actual
strength. I can't measure up with much success
against Jimmy."</p>

<p>But nevertheless he climbed to the position
on the bar. "Count for me," he said to Frank,
and Frank began, while David swung up and
down with the regularity of a pendulum. He
passed Jimmy's figures without a bit of effort
apparently, reached twenty, and then the boys
began to open their eyes. He did not stop at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
twenty, but kept it up without fatigue until he
reached the great number of forty-two times.
Then he stopped, but looked as though he might
have continued for five minutes longer.</p>

<p>"Hats off to David Powers," said Frank, which,
seeing that they had no hats on, was not a thing
difficult of accomplishment. "Isn't he the dandy
little dipper?"</p>

<p>"He certainly is," agreed Jimmy. "How on
earth do you do it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm built for it," said David, looking
down at his twisted legs. "Patsy says all my
strength has gone to my arms and shoulders. He
says the record for the dip is 66, made five or
six years ago by one of the football fellows."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you beat it before you get through,"
said Frank, admiringly.</p>

<p>"I'd like to."</p>

<p>"Then the record you made would go down
over on the wall there to stay until some other
fellow did better."</p>

<p>"I don't think I can ever do it, but as it is one
of the few things I can do, I'll keep busy at it,"
said David.</p>

<p>Patsy strolled up at this moment, and they told
him what they had been at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can never beat David Powers at dipping
or pulling up on the horizontal bar. Did you
ever see him climbing the rope? He's been down
here in the mornings, learning how to do that."</p>

<p>"O-ho, Mr. Powers," said Frank, "is that
where you sneak off to in the mornings, down
to the gym, eh? Well, you are out after the
records, aren't you?" But there was a note of
pride in Frank's tone as he looked at the little
chap.</p>

<p>"Come on, David, show them how a cat goes
up a rope," said Patsy. He loosened the climbing
rope from the side of the gallery, and let it
swing to its position with a clear space of twenty-five
feet to the rafters, where it was attached
by an eye-bolt. David moved over to the rope
by the aid of his cane, with which he could get
around in the gymnasium, seized the rope and
went up it hand over hand, like a sailor. It
seemed hardly more than a half dozen breaths
before he had reached the very top of the rope,
touched the rafter, slid down the rope, and was
with them again on the floor.</p>

<p>"There's only two fellows in this whole school
who can beat that, and even now I think he'd
give them a good tussle if it came to a contest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Before the winter is over we'll have the gym
trials, and then you'll see some good contests.
I'm backing this young fellow Freshman to win
some points if he keeps up his improvement,"
said Patsy, laying his hand on David's shoulder.
David smiled in a pleased manner and looked
down.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take good care I don't get into any
rope-climbing contests with him; I'd come out at
the little end of the horn," said Frank.</p>

<p>"And I'll dodge them, too," remarked Jimmy.</p>

<p>"And I'm thinking of entering the dip contests
and the rope-climbing myself," said Lewis, which
raised a laugh.</p>

<p>"Lewis, you could climb a rope if it was
stretched along the ground, all right," said
Jimmy, "or if you had a convenient elevator."</p>

<p>"You are all very discouraging to a really good
athlete. Some day I'll show you fellows," said
the disgruntled Lewis.</p>

<p>It was a few days after the incident in the
gymnasium that the scouts of the Gamma Tau
looked in on Jimmy and Frank again, but they
were met with the same answer. "This is the
last time," Cuthbert said to Frank. "We've got
about all the men we want now. We'd like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
have you both come in. And don't forget that
you can't get very far in this school without the
help of Gamma Tau."</p>

<p>To this very direct threat both boys who were
sought, answered firmly that if they couldn't
get along without Gamma Tau they would have
to do without the delightful backing of that autocrat
society. Frank was so outspoken that he
raised Cuthbert's ire before the call was over;
and the caller intimated that if Frank had any
ambitions in the direction of the baseball nine
in the spring he might as well bury them, for
he couldn't get on it.</p>

<p>"Why, Simpson, the captain, is one of our biggest
men, and I think you're a fool not to play
for his friendship."</p>

<p>But the argument had no strength with Frank,
who saw more and more the bad effect of the
fraternity in the school life. It made a clique
of fellows who considered themselves a little better
than the boys who were not in its membership.</p>

<p>"You fellows are going to have a tumble some
of these days. You can't run things here all
the time."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we can run them as far as you're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
concerned, Mr. Frank Armstrong. You can set
that down in your diary and refer to it next
spring about baseball time. Good night. Remember,
it's the last call for dinner."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Cuthbert. I know it is considered
an honor to be given the chance to come in,
but I'm going to stay outside, for I think I
can do better without Gamma Tau. And if I
can't, well, then I'll have to do worse. If you
fellows don't look out, some one will start another
society."</p>

<p>"It's been tried," said Cuthbert, now at the
door with his hand on the knob. "It's been tried
two or three times, but it never comes to anything.
All I can say is, that you are letting a
good chance go. But fools will be fools. Good
night."</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XXI.</span><span class="subtit">THE LOSS OF A RINK.</span></h2>


<p>It was a very open fall that first year of Frank's
at Queen's School, and despite the fact that the
boys who were inclined to the game of hockey
prayed fervently for good ice, Jack Frost held
off. Several times it threatened to freeze up,
and there was a great polishing and sharpening
of skates and seeing to the leather straps.</p>

<p>"When the ice comes we'll get up a hockey
team," said Frank to Jimmy one day, meeting
him in the yard. "Neither of us will get a chance
at the school team, so we might as well have
some fun ourselves."</p>

<p>"And who will we play with, I'd like to know,
supposing the ice did come, and supposing we
could get up a team?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet you the best hockey stick in Milton
that there'll be lots of chances. There'll be so
many scrub sevens out that there won't be enough
ice. Are you game for it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure thing," said Jimmy. "We can rope
Lewis in. There's a fellow in my entry named
Hazard who drops in evenings to borrow a book.
He says he can skate. Lewis isn't a half bad
skater, and he's so fat that he would naturally
get in the way of the puck without being very
quick. So he would be a good goal tender."</p>

<p>"Good enough," returned Frank. "That
makes four, and we can pick three other fellows
up somewhere. Be on the look out and I'll keep
my eye out, too. Meantime, pray for the ice."</p>

<p>But all things, as the copybooks say, come to
him who waits. About the middle of December
sharper weather came on, and then one afternoon
the mercury began to slide down the tube of
the thermometer. At six o'clock in the evening
it stood at zero, and the boys covered the distance
from their rooms to the dining hall supper
table and back in record time, owing to the
biting air.</p>

<p>Frank was over to see Jimmy that night and
reported that the big thermometer that his father
had given him, and which hung outside his window,
registered seven below.</p>

<p>"And it's going down further, and what's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
equally good, there hasn't been a bit of wind
since the cold snap came."</p>

<p>"And what has wind to do with it?" inquired
Lewis.</p>

<p>"Hasn't anything to do with the freezing, but
with wind the ice is rough. I met Potter coming
up from the ice just before dark and he says it's
like glass, and is so thick now he could hardly
punch his heel through it."</p>

<p>"Sounds good," said Jimmy. "We will then,
to-night, organize the great Armstrong hockey
club."</p>

<p>"No, don't call it after me. I may not be
good enough to stick on. But we've got to have
a name. Suggest something, Lewis."</p>

<p>"Well," said the goal-tender-to-be, "I guess we
might as well call it the Lollipops. Sweet things
on the end of a stick, you know."</p>

<p>"Hurray for the goal-tender. Lollipops it will
be! The Lollipop Hockey Club of Queen's
School. First practice to-morrow afternoon at
three thirty. How does that hit you?" said
Frank.</p>

<p>"All right for me," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"And me, too," piped up Lewis. "I'll show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
you the way to stop 'em. If you can get them
past your Uncle Dudley, you will be going some."</p>

<p>"All right, Fatty," said Jimmy. "If you play
half as well as you talk we will have the real
thing in a hockey team."</p>

<p>Frank's prediction came true about the freeze,
and what it would do. Before the thermometer
got through on its shivering downward course
it touched ten below, some time during the night,
and then travelled upward again; but by the
middle of the next forenoon it was back to ten
degrees above. It was still pretty nippy, but
just the right brace was in the air for violent
exercise. The boys could hardly wait for the
middle of the afternoon to come around. Some
of them had already been on the glittering surface
of the river, and reported it like glass, and
four inches thick.</p>

<p>Frank had selected a place about a hundred
yards up the river for the site of his rink. It
was a spot in a small cove, pretty well sheltered
by trees and protected from the sharp winds
which blew across the more exposed parts of the
river. For the first day the Lollipops and a
dozen others of the class, any one in fact who
came along, contented themselves with tearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
up and down the ice and shooting a puck between
piles of coats which did duty for a cage. Wearying
of this unorganized exercise after a while,
Jimmy, Lewis and Frank picked up their coats
and started up the river in the direction of Warwick,
five miles away.</p>

<p>They swung along easily, enjoying the freshness
and crispness of the air, and the really wonderful
ice under foot. Half way up to the rival
school they met several of the skaters from that
school, among them big Channing of the football
team, who nodded pleasantly to Jimmy and came
to a halt.</p>

<p>"Are you going to have a hockey team down
there this year?" Channing asked, nodding his
head in the direction of Queen's. "If you are,
we want to get a game or two."</p>

<p>"Yes, there will be a school team I guess, particularly
if the ice holds out, but we are only
Freshmen and will probably not get a chance at
it," said Jimmy. "They had a team last year,
didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we beat it 15 to 4, and we want to
get a chance to do it again. It might help
Queen's to put a few lively young Freshmen on
it. I'd advise you to try."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have, or are going to have a team of
our own, and we will masquerade under the
splendid name of the Lollipops. We'll give you
a game when we learn how to stand on our
skates," said Frank, laughingly.</p>

<p>"All right, Lollipops, that's a go, in case Dixon
can't get a classy seven together."</p>

<p>"Chip Dixon, is he the captain?" said Frank,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I heard he was elected. He's
about the roughest player Queen's has had on
the team, but when he roughed it we roughed
it, and the result was while he was doing nothing
else but roughing it, we were playing a little
hockey. Dixon was one of the best players on
Queen's, but lost his temper and hit one of our
forwards a deliberate blow over the arm with his
stick. It came to be pretty nearly a general row
all around. Our fellows are just aching to get at
Queen's again."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better send a challenge down. I'm
not on good terms with Mr. Dixon," said Frank.
"Perhaps he will take you on. But if he doesn't,
we'll put you on our schedule when we learn to
toddle around and hang onto a stick."</p>

<p>The group parted company. When the trio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
returned to the float, scores of fellows were darting
around here and there on their skates, and
a large bonfire had been built on the bank, which
threw a cheerful light over the sparkling ice and
helped to dispel the darkness which had already
begun to fall.</p>

<p>Before night came on, however, our founders
of the Lollipop Club had laid out their rink in
the little cove. They set down four blocks of
wood about five inches in diameter, two at each
end of the "grounds," chipping out little pockets
in the ice, into which the blocks were set. Then
they filled these pockets with water.</p>

<p>"Those posts will be as steady as the gate posts
of Queen's School by to-morrow morning," observed
Frank, "if nobody bothers them. It will
certainly make a dandy place to play," he added,
looking around. "It's just off the line of travel,
enough so it won't interfere with general skating,
and our posts will be in no one's way."</p>

<p>Every one was well tired that night. The unusual
exercise of skating and the violent way
most of them had gone into it left them with
aching bones and muscles. After supper Frank
and Jimmy went around, and completed the Lollipop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
seven from the ranks of Freshmen they
knew.</p>

<p>"When we get started, I'll bet we have dozens
more than we want. And when they see Lewis
on the job they'll pay us money to let them in
with us."</p>

<p>The weather held sharp and clear, and the following
morning two inches more had been added
to the river's coating. It was now safe beyond
any doubt. Frank, during the forenoon, was
down to the river to see how the marks they had
set were standing. He reported that they were
as stiff as rocks. They were like posts which
had been let down through the ice and anchored
in the mud of the river.</p>

<p>That afternoon the Lollipops made their descent
on Wampaug river in full force. Jimmy
had succeeded in finding a couple of other
Freshmen for substitutes to complete the quota of
players. When the news of the formation of a
Freshman team was noised around, it was evident
that there would be no trouble in finding plenty
of opponents, for every one on the river had a
stick, and the novelty of gliding up and down
merely for skating's sake had passed. Frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
was besieged by applicants. So they rushed down
across the field, got into their skates at the boat-house
float, and struck up the river to a chatter
of excitement at the beginning the club was to
have.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that for a nerve?"
cried Frank, as coming around a curve from
the float which had hidden the "grounds" that
they had laid out the night before, they saw
that the place was already occupied. "And, by
George, it's Chip Dixon. I'll be jiggered if it
isn't."</p>

<p>The Lollipops skated up slowly, but their arrival
seemed to have no effect on the boys who
were occupying their rink. Frank recognized,
besides Chip, several of the Gamma Tau men,
among them Cuthbert of the nine, who had been
after candidates for the society not so long before,
Boston Wheeler, the fullback of the eleven,
and several others. They paid not the slightest
attention to the real proprietors of the territory,
but kept on gaily with their play.</p>

<p>A slashing drive sent the puck to the river
bank, and while some one was recovering it
Frank sculled slowly over to Chip and said, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
think you have our 'grounds,' haven't you? We
laid these out last night, and planted the markers."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so?" said Chip, indifferently.
"Very nice of you. We like the place very much,
indeed."</p>

<p>"But it is ours, and we want to play. It isn't
the regular practice place of the school team, is
it?"</p>

<p>"Our regular practice place is wherever we
want to play, so run along, Freshie, and don't
bother us. All right, I've got you"&mdash;this to a
mate who sent the puck spinning across the ice
in Chip's direction. Thereafter Chip was busily
engaged, and paid no attention whatever to the
Lollipops, who stood around glumly, hardly daring
to break out into open revolt.</p>

<p>"Dixon has done this for spite and nothing
else," said Jimmy. "The Wee One told me that
the school team generally practises just below
the boat-house float. I'd like to knock his head
off," and Jimmy grabbed his stick and swung it
around him vigorously. "I'll get even with him
for this, see if I don't."</p>

<p>"He's got it in for both of us," said Frank, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
had now turned his back on the players. "We
can't make a fuss, although we do know he has
chucked us out of our own place. Come on, let's
go up the river and find another place where&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Frank had not done speaking when a terrific
collision sent him sprawling on his face, and
as he got to his feet again a sarcastic voice said:
"Can't you keep out of the way? Can't you give
us room to play our game?"</p>

<p>It was Chip, who had deliberately run into
Frank when the latter was unprepared and given
him a nasty fall. Blood was trickling from a
cut over Frank's eye where he had struck the
ice. The sight of the blood made Jimmy wild
with anger. He helped Frank to get his balance
and then turned on Chip, who had started to
skate away.</p>

<p>"That was a contemptible trick, Dixon," he
said, "and for two pins I'd punch your head for
you, although you are the captain."</p>

<p>Chip heard and wheeled like a flash. He drove
straight at Jimmy, and swung his stick at the latter's
head. Jimmy saw him coming in time, sidestepped
the rush, stuck out his foot, and Dixon
went head over heels sprawling on the ice.
Jimmy followed him, just as eager as Chip was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
to settle the matter there and then with blows,
but Chip had received a tumble which took a
good deal of the fight out of him, and by the
time he had regained his feet a crowd of boys
were in between the two.</p>

<p>"You'll pay for this, you red-headed little
chump," said Chip, savagely, rubbing his bumped
skull. "I'll pound you within an inch of your
life if I ever catch you where your friends can't
interfere."</p>

<p>"It's your friends who are interfering," said
Jimmy, coolly, holding his ground. "I'll settle
it right now if you wish, you cowardly bully."
And Jimmy threw his stick on the ice, his eyes
blazing.</p>

<p>Frank, who had recovered from his cruel fall,
skated over to Jimmy and slipped his arm around
him, saying: "Don't mind about it, Jimmy. He
isn't worth while. Let's go up the river and pick
out another place, and have our little fun, for
there isn't much daylight left. Come on, Lollipops."
Jimmy picked up his stick slowly, keeping
a savage eye on Dixon, and somewhat reluctantly
followed Frank and the others a hundred
yards or so up-stream. The encounter had been
watched by a score or more of boys, none of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
whom cared much about Chip's way of doing
things. But they were much attracted to the
young Freshman who had dared the mighty
Dixon in his own lair. So they followed Frank
and Jimmy to the new place, where coat-markers
were laid down. In the vigorous play that followed,
the clash of the afternoon was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>"I was a fool to get mad," said Jimmy as they
trudged homeward over the frozen ground, "but
he set me boiling, and I lost my red head entirely."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he'll try to get you some time and
may do you some harm."</p>

<p>"Not he. I can take care of myself, and don't
you worry about that, Frank. I believe he has
a yellow streak in him. I'm ready for him any
time."</p>

<p>And at about the same time Chip Dixon was
travelling back to the yard in a group of his
cronies. "I'll get that red-headed guy some day
and knock that carroty nut clean off his shoulders,"
said Chip. But at the moment he said it,
he wondered a little if it might not be a pretty
hard job.</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XXII.</span><span class="subtit">A HEROIC RESCUE.</span></h2>


<p>The encounter between Chip and Jimmy on
the ice that afternoon was the talk of the whole
school at the supper table, and when the two
boys concerned passed near each other on the
way out the onlookers stepped aside fearful that
something might take place there and then, but
nothing happened.</p>

<p>In general the school sympathized with the
Freshman, but Dixon wielded so much influence
in the school and bullied it so unmercifully that
there was not much public expression of opinion.
A good many thought that if it came to a matter
of collision between them with a fair field that
Jimmy would be Dixon's match, for they had seen
the former play football, and although he was
not as big as Dixon they knew how sturdy he
was, and how determined he would probably be
in a fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy, although he knew in his heart that
the matter would have to be settled between them
before his school life was over, was very docile,
and when Frank said that evening: "Jimmy, I
don't want you to get into any scraps about me.
I'd much rather take another cut eye from Chip,
although I don't relish it a bit, than to have you
get into trouble or get scrapping with anyone
on my account. I wanted to go for Dixon myself
this afternoon, but you know what the school
rules are about it&mdash;suspension or possible dismissal."</p>

<p>"All right, boss," said Jimmy. "I'll behave,
but the big chump made me mad, first taking our
rink and second smashing into you when your
back was turned. You'll have to admit that he
got what he deserved. I noticed that his eye was
good and black where he came in contact with the
ice when I tripped him that time he rushed me."</p>

<p>"Just like mine," said Frank, laughing.
Frank's eye, too, had a fine, dark tint underneath,
and with a piece of sticking plaster over his eyebrow,
he looked anything but attractive.</p>

<p>"Anyone to see you, Frank, would think you
had been playing football," observed David,
"but it might have been worse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," returned Frank, "it might have been
both eyes."</p>

<p>"It's a better combination," laughed David, "to
have one blue one and one black one; kind of
gives variety to your features."</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and the Wee
One strolled into the room.</p>

<p>"Hello, pugilists," he said to Frank and
Jimmy. "Understand you are both matched for
the heavyweight class. Can't I come in on the
scrapping somewhere?"</p>

<p>"You aren't even in the featherweight class,"
said Gleason.</p>

<p>"What would you call me then?"</p>

<p>"O, I think about the postage-stamp class."</p>

<p>"Well," retorted the Wee One, "I'd be a good
postage stamp, for I don't remember that I've
been licked yet."</p>

<p>"Old, very old," said Gleason. "I think I
have the record of that here," and he pretended
to search through his notebook. "Yes, here it
is&mdash;'postage-stamp joke, first to be taken in out
of the wet by Noah's secretary, who had the job
of collecting all the old jokes. Said to have first
been uttered by Adam.'"</p>

<p>"Well, it's a good easy joke to understand; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
isn't like the ones you get off, Gleason. Yours
need a chart with them," retorted the Wee One.</p>

<p>"We're going to have some big doings at the
rink to-morrow afternoon, will you come down
and referee, Patty?" said Frank.</p>

<p>"Sure I'll come, and I'm the dandy little
referee. Refereed for years at the St. Nicholas
Rink. Yale, Princeton and Harvard cried for
me, and once I was in the hospital, and they
wouldn't play the game."</p>

<p>"It's a fine thing to have a reputation," said
Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Much better to have an imagination like the
Wee One's, though," said David.</p>

<p>"What are the doings?" inquired the referee.
"Are you going to take on Chip's bunch?"</p>

<p>"Not on the picture of the Sacred Cow. We
are going to play with gentlemen&mdash;that is, we
are going to have a game with ourselves. Since
there will be no more scrapping you will be safe.
We will promise not to speak even an unkind
word to you," said Frank.</p>

<p>"And I'll be down to keep the record of all the
perfectly lovely tallies," said Gleason.</p>

<p>"You will not need to bring a large book.
Lewis is goal-tender, and he's so fat that the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
way to score is to throw the puck right through
him, and he's so thick that that is about impossible."</p>

<p>After more chaff and banter the Wee One got
up.</p>

<p>"I must be going," he said. "I'm tired as a
whole family of dogs, and I'm going to sleep without
bothering my head about that algebra which
comes to-morrow morning. If you hear any
loud sounds pretty soon you'll not be alarmed,
but know that it's your happy referee preparing
for to-morrow's fracas. My room-mate's home
for a few days, so I'll have the place all to myself.
Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night," echoed the boys. Jimmy took
his departure a few minutes later, and Frank,
being tired from the exercise of the afternoon,
turned in. David followed as he always followed
Frank in everything. Gleason sat pegging away
at some obstreperous lesson, and then he, too,
with a prodigious yawn, slammed his book shut,
and went to his own chamber. Darkness settled
upon the old dormitory, and the boys slept.</p>

<p>Frank was dreaming that he was in the middle
of a most exciting hockey game. The puck was
flying hither and thither, and the spectators were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
yelling like mad. Suddenly he woke to the realization
that there was a yelling, but that it came
from the outside, and not from the dream spectators.
He sat up in bed and listened. There
was a clattering in the entry, a confused sound of
voices outside, and then the chapel bell began to
ring wildly. What did it all mean? David was
also awake now and staring. Suddenly through
all the noise outside rose the clear cry:</p>

<p>"Fire! fire! fire!" The terrible cry in the
middle of the night brought Frank out of bed
standing. He pulled David to his feet, helped
him on with a few scanty clothes, and was picking
up more clothes, when one of the teachers
burst into the room.</p>

<p>"Warren is on fire," he yelled; "hurry up.
Fire in the next entry."</p>

<p>Frank and David lost no time in getting down
to the ground where they found half of the school
already assembled, watching the smoke rolling
from the entry windows. No one knew how the
fire had started, but the night watchman of the
school on making his rounds had smelled smoke,
and on investigation located it in the first entry.
Quick action by the watchman had raised the
alarm, and the boys all over the dormitory were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
flying from their beds as Frank and David and
Gleason had flown. They gathered outside to
watch the progress of the flames.</p>

<p>There was a hasty count of noses by Mr. Parks.
"Thank heaven, they are all out!" he exclaimed.
And it was well, for the smoke was now beginning
to roll threateningly from the upper windows
of the entry, and now and then a little glint
of flames showed where the fire was gaining
headway. Across the yard came rattling the volunteer
fire apparatus manned by some of the bigger
boys and the teachers. Queen's had always
boasted a fire department, but there never had
been a real test of it, and now that the test had
come they seemed terribly slow in getting the hose
attached to the hydrant which was fed from the
reservoir upon the hill.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, Frank began to look for the
Wee One. A terrible thought came to him that
he might still be in his room. "Where is Patterson?"
he cried frantically, hoping to hear an
answer from the Wee One from some safe position
on the ground, but there was no answer.
It was with a white face that he turned to Mr.
Parks, and said: "Patterson must be in his room;
he's not down here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"He couldn't sleep through all this noise, surely
not," said Mr. Parks.</p>

<p>"He was in my room last night, and said he
was very tired and would sleep sound. O, he
must be there and we must save him." He
rushed to the doorway up which some of the volunteers
were trying to carry the hose, but he
was forced back by a dense cloud of black smoke
which whirled down the stairway. The stairway
was evidently on fire somewhere up
above.</p>

<p>"Come round to the end of Warren," yelled
Frank. "One of Patterson's bedroom windows is
on the end of the building." A score of boys,
hearing his words, tore around to the end of the
building, but the Wee One's room was dark.</p>

<p>Frank turned his gaze on the ground, and good
fortune favored him when he saw a lump of
frozen turf which lay by the edge of the walk.
He picked it up, and with a throw as accurate
as if he were sending a ball over the plate, he
sent the lump of earth smashing through Patterson's
bedroom window. The signal was effective.
In a moment a white-clad figure appeared at the
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter?" it yelled. "What are
you throwing rocks through my window for?"
The tone was highly indignant.</p>

<p>"The dormitory is afire," yelled the voices below.
The white-robed figure left the bedroom
window only to return in a moment.</p>

<p>"The study is full of smoke," shouted the Wee
One from his lofty position. "Someone get a
ladder. I'll have to come down this way." He
was hanging over the window sill, and leaning
far out so he could make his voice heard. "It's
getting mighty hot here; the fire seems to be in
the entry outside my door, but I've got my door
between the bedroom here and the study shut.
Won't some one hurry with a ladder?"</p>

<p>"Hurray, here comes the ladder," the crowd
shouted as two fellows came running with the
ladder on their shoulders. All hands gave assistance
to planting the ladder firmly, and swung
it end up toward the window. The Wee One had
slipped up the lower sash, and was climbing out
on the narrow ledge, making ready to escape.</p>

<p>"It is too short," cried the crowd below in horror.
It was true! The top of the ladder did
not reach the ledge, where the Wee One maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
with difficulty his slender footing, by at
least five feet.</p>

<p>"Lift it up," cried some one, and a dozen eager
hands seized the ladder and pushed its end closer
to Patterson, who began to kneel down so that
he could put his feet on the top round when it
reached him; but just as he was feeling for it
the ladder, held on its foundation of insecure
human muscle, swayed, slipped, and went crashing
to the ground where one of its sides snapped
like a pipe-stem.</p>

<p>When the spectators saw what had happened,
a murmur of horror passed their lips. There
seemed nothing now but death for the boy who
clung desperately to the window thirty feet above
them. There was no other ladder, and apparently
no human help. By this time the fire had eaten
a hole in the roof, and was shooting merrily
through, lighting the whole place up with a bright
glare. Evidently, too, it had eaten through the
door of Patterson's study, for little puffs of smoke
began to appear at the end windows of the study,
and a glare filled the room.</p>

<p>The Wee One begged piteously for help, and
then, turning, looked into the room he had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
left. Then he turned his face to the ground,
and made a movement as if to jump.</p>

<p>"Don't jump, don't jump, don't jump!" yelled
the crowd in chorus. "Here's a rope for you."
Mr. Parks now appeared with a coil of stout
rope and threw it with all his might at the window.
It didn't quite carry up to it. Frantically
he snatched it up again and threw. This time
the unwinding end dropped across the window
sill, hung a moment and slipped back before Patterson
could grasp it. Mr. Parks tried again,
but this time failed to get the rope near the window.</p>

<p>"Let me have it," said a calm voice at his
elbow. "Let me try." It was David. All looked
at him in open-mouthed astonishment. "I can't
throw it, I'll carry it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>David pointed to the great woodbine vine
which, with its stout stem, crept over the whole
end of the building. It had been planted many
years before. Unmolested its tendrils had shot
their way into the crevices between the bricks,
making a kind of lattice work. "There's a
chance," he said, "and I'll try. It's the only way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
to save him. Quick, tie the rope around me and
help me to the wall."</p>

<p>Willing fingers knotted the rope around his
waist, and bore him to the wall, the crutches dropping
from his hands. They pushed him up the
wall as far as they could, and then let go. Up
that mat of woodbine vine David went like a
monkey, the tail of rope dangling out behind.
Where the growth was large he seemed to have
no difficulty, but as he advanced there was less
grip for his hands, and once he stopped ten feet
below the window where the Wee One was hanging.</p>

<p>"He can't make it, he can't make it," moaned
the crowd.</p>

<p>But the little hero is only momentarily balked.
Holding his weight with one hand, he tears loose
a section of the vine to get a better grip, drives
his bleeding fingers in between the vine and the
bricks, and goes on. Now he is only a few feet below
the ledge. Now he has reached it, thrown a
hand over it, and climbed onto it. The crowd
below are as still as death, but David works with
a coolness worthy of the trained fireman. They
can even see him smile a little at the Wee One,
evidently encouraging him. Then he has slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
into the room, made a hitch securely to the bed
leg, which is near the window, and handed the
Wee One the rope.</p>

<p>There is not a whisper as the Wee One takes
it, gets a coil of the rope around his arm and
another around his leg, and begins to slide. Below
someone is holding the rope out from the wall
so he will not tear himself on the bricks and
vines, and almost before it is realized he is standing
on the ground beside them, safe and sound,
excepting a few bruises where he came in too
close contact with the wall.</p>

<p>And now over the window ledge slides David.
He is at home on a rope, thanks to his practice
in the gymnasium, and it is but a small trick
for him to slip down its length. And what a
cheer bursts from the crowd as he is grasped in
the arms of his friends! He is carried bodily,
like a baby, by half a dozen fellows to one of
the Senior apartments over in Honeywell Hall,
where the Wee One has already been taken, and
the school, forgetting the fire in the wonderful
act of bravery, follows at his heels, shouting his
name.</p>

<p>In an hour it was all over. The volunteers
forced their way up the stairs, got to the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
which had originated in the air shaft, and succeeded
in dampening it with water and chemicals
so thoroughly that it was soon under control.
Patterson's room was pretty badly burned out,
and the roof at that point was burned off. But
no lives were lost, thanks to David.</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XXIII.</span><span class="subtit">A CHALLENGE FROM WARWICK.</span></h2>


<p>"They are making a great deal of fuss about
nothing," said David, the day after the fire. "I'm
sure it wasn't half as hard as it would have been
to climb a rope that distance. The vines gave
me a great grip."</p>

<p>David and Frank had just come across the
yard from luncheon, and everywhere they were
greeted with friendly nods from the members of
all classes.</p>

<p>"That lame fellow is the one who saved Patterson
last night," spoken in low tones, was frequently
heard as the two went along. In the
class-room, the boys and the teachers themselves
applauded David's action until he felt like running
away and hiding.</p>

<p>"I did nothing much anyway," he would say,
blushing.</p>

<p>That morning old Doctor Hobart sent for
David, and David was embarrassed by his praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"You did a fine thing, young man, a noble
thing. We will not forget it. You do not look
strong enough to perform the feat. I myself
saw you when you were half way up the wall.
I'm not sure I should have allowed you to go up
had I seen you when you began your attempt.
Where did you get that strength, for it must have
taken a great deal?" and the old gentleman bent
forward in his chair and scrutinized kindly the
slender boy.</p>

<p>"I wanted to be able to do something for the
school besides my lessons and the only thing I
could do was something for my hands and arms.
I've been working mornings at the gymnasium,
rope climbing and taking exercise on the parallel
bars."</p>

<p>"O, I see," said the Doctor. "Well, the good
Lord just brought you here. It is most fortunate
that you had developed yourself as you
did, for I doubt if anyone else could have had
the strength, to say nothing of the courage, to do
it."</p>

<p>"But he was my friend, and I had to do it when
the ladder broke."</p>

<p>"Well, it was a brave thing and we will remember
it. I will take pleasure in giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
facts of your action to your father, Colonel
Powers."</p>

<p>The only one who did not credit David with
anything extraordinary was Dixon. He made
light of the whole thing.</p>

<p>"No wonder he could climb, he has no legs to
speak of. Patterson wouldn't have jumped or
fallen anyway." This argument was meant to
end it, but although he was with his cronies, he
had not much support in this view.</p>

<p>The fire and rescue were the talk of the school
for several days, but the ice was good and the
river sports took the attention of the active-minded
boys, much to David's rejoicing. Afternoons
were devoted to hockey, racing, fancy skating
and just plain skating.</p>

<p>Warwick had sent down her best seven with
Channing at its head, and challenged Dixon's
team to a game. A temporary rink of boards was
hastily put up with the assistance of the school
carpenter. Posts were let through the ice and
firmly driven into the mud at intervals of every
eight feet, and on these were nailed boards to the
height of nearly three feet. The boards made a
firm barrier for the puck. Dixon and his team-mates
had practiced every minute, but when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
test with Warwick came the latter wily individuals
carried away the honors.</p>

<p>It was a sharp game, but the team work which
had been shown in the football game the previous
month was again apparent in the game on the
ice, and it bore down all obstacles. And Dixon's
team was not really as strong in opposing Warwick
as in football. They were not together.
Twice, by sheer force and rough tactics, they got
the puck past the Warwick goal-tender, but this
was all. Warwick scored seven times by pretty
passing and elusive dodging. As the game began
to go against Queen's the latter tried rougher
and rougher tactics, but they only opened their
defence more and more, and Warwick piled up
the tallies.</p>

<p>"Is that the best hockey team you can get in
Queen's?" asked a Warwick boy who was watching
the game. "We have at least three teams
that could take that aggregation into camp."</p>

<p>The Wee One, who was standing with Frank,
Jimmy and a group of Freshmen just at that
point, answered him: "No, we have at least half
a dozen that could trim it."</p>

<p>"Well, why on earth don't you have them play?
Those fellows, with the exception of your left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
forward, and Dixon there, can hardly stand on
their skates, let alone play the game of hockey."</p>

<p>"You see the captain has lots of friends, and he
plays whoever he wants to on his team. The
good players don't happen to be friends of his,
so they don't play. See the point?"</p>

<p>The Wee One had recovered from his scare
at the fire, and while he had been very friendly
with Frank and David from the very first, he
was with them most of the time now. He hadn't
said much to David, but his eyes spoke volumes of
regard and affection for his rescuer.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Warwick boy, "it's no fun to
win a game like that. Since hockey is a closed
sport to the best players down here, I'm going to
try to get Channing to challenge Queen's to a
series of races before this good ice gets away
from us or a big snow storm comes on. Dixon
couldn't keep the good skaters out of such races,
could he?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Wee One, "not if the challenge
came to all the school. He probably wouldn't
go into it at all since he couldn't run it."</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;then I'll get after Channing. The way
to do it would be to have tryouts in both schools
and let the fastest skaters meet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys agreed that it would be a great plan,
and promised their aid.</p>

<p>"You'll enter, won't you, Jimmy, and you,
Frank?" said Patterson.</p>

<p>"Sure," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Get Channing to send a challenge to the whole
school," continued Patterson. "Have him send it
to Mr. Parks, who is a friend of the school athletics
and always willing to help."</p>

<p>The hockey game had ended by this time, and
the triumphant Warwickites went back up the
river shouting a song of victory which did not
strike pleasantly on the ears of the defeated
Queen's team. It had been customary for the
teams to cheer each other, but Dixon and his
players had climbed out of the rink without a
word, taken off their skates and gone sullenly
to the gymnasium.</p>

<p>True to his word, the Warwick boy, who had
proposed the ice carnival on the afternoon of the
hockey game, took the matter to Channing, and
that young man was eager for it.</p>

<p>"We've beaten Queen's in baseball this year,
football and hockey, and we'd beat them if they
had basket-ball, and we'll clean them up on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
ice races. We can beat them at anything from
tiddle-de-winks up to throwing the javelin. They
have a society down there which runs athletics,
and until they get over that disease the best fellows
in the school are not allowed to play. That
hockey game this afternoon was a joke."</p>

<p>Channing got to work at once and spread the
proposed plan about Warwick. It was eagerly
taken up, and the result was the following challenge
in the morning's mail:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="spaced fp">"To Queen's School:</p>

<p>"Warwick School challenges you to a series of
ice races on the Wampaug river on Saturday of
this week. We propose a half-mile race, a hundred-yard
race, and a mile race,&mdash;all to be skated
straightaway, without turns&mdash;each school to hold
its trials and present only its best skaters in these
events. The racing to be open to everyone in each
school, and the entrants are to be chosen only on
merit.</p>

<p class="center nomargin">"(Signed) <span class="smcap">Robert Channing</span>,</p>
<p class="rightal nomargin">"For Warwick School."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Parks, thoroughly in sympathy with anything
which was in the nature of a good, clean
contest, particularly when it was on such a broad
basis, was heartily in favor of the movement for
a competition, and posted the letter conspicuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
on the bulletin board in the gymnasium
vestibule.</p>

<p>The letter attracted much attention, and every
boy in Queen's who could skate, or thought he
could, entered his name on a long sheet of paper
which Mr. Parks put there for that purpose. Of
course, Frank, Jimmy and Lewis were entered.
Their names were among the first to go down
in their class.</p>

<p>On the shining ice just below Queen's a measured
course was laid off by Mr. Parks, and the
boys who intended to skate did their practising
there. The course for the contest was to be
laid equi-distant from each school so that there
would be no favor to either, and where the ice
was not so much cut up as it was near the schools.</p>

<p>That evening Jimmy and Lewis dropped into
Frank's room to talk it over. They had all been
out on the ice trying the various distances. Lewis
thought his distance was the hundred yards.</p>

<p>"All you have to do in that," he said, "is to
take one big breath and let 'er go. I think I
made the best time over that distance."</p>

<p>"You did like fun," said Jimmy. "You were
half way down the course when I started and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
passed you before we got to the finish. If Channing
had suggested a ten-yard dash, I'd have bet
on you, Lewis. As it is, I don't think you'll
do better than tenth in the hundred."</p>

<p>"I wish I had a decent pair of skates," said
Frank. "These old ones of mine are too small
for me, and when I get to going fast they don't
run well. I guess it's because they haven't
enough bearing surface on the ice."</p>

<p>"What are you going to enter, Frank?" asked
David.</p>

<p>"Seems to me," said Frank, "that the half
mile is my best distance. I can't get going in the
hundred. Jimmy goes the hundred like a breeze.
And the whole mile is too much for me. If
I had a longer pair of skates I could do better,
but there's no time to get any so I'll have to do
with these."</p>

<p>"Wheeler has entered in the half mile, I see,"
said Jimmy, "and he's a terror. Not particularly
graceful, but he's as strong as a bull. Have you
noticed that Dixon hasn't entered any of the
races?"</p>

<p>"I was looking for his name, but it isn't on
the list. Just the same, he was out practising this
afternoon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't see him," said Frank. "What was he
working at?"</p>

<p>"The half mile," said Lewis. "He didn't come
out till after you left the ice, and I think he's
down there now. I met him and some of his
cronies when I was coming over here, and they
had their skates. I think he's after your scalp.
And he's mighty fast on his skates, too."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't be afraid of him the least
little bit if I had skates that fitted me. Maybe
I can borrow a pair, but it's not likely, as every
one who can stand on skates will be out on the day
of the races. I'll do the best I can with what
I've got. But maybe he won't enter since he can't
run it to suit himself. Mr. Parks, you know, has
taken charge of the whole thing, and he, with a
Warwick School teacher, is going to be judge at
the finish line."</p>

<p>"That sounds good to me," said Jimmy; "there
will be no monkey business about it now. It will
be a fair race and no favors to anyone, and the
fastest wins. I sent my skates to the grinder to-day,
and they are as sharp as a razor&mdash;too sharp
for the best skating. I'll have to take the edge off
a little with emery cloth. When they're too sharp
they grab the ice too hard, and don't slip easily."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>On Thursday came the trial for Queen's School.
Mr. Parks was in charge, and saw to it that
everything was fair and square. Ten boys lined
up for the hundred yards. At half the distance
four went out in front. Jimmy was second and
going well. Hillard, of the eleven, led by a yard
or two, but coming to the very end Jimmy put
on a great burst of speed and overhauled him.
The two crossed the mark together, breast and
breast. A fellow named Robbins was third. The
other seven were strung along over a distance
of ten or fifteen yards. Lewis was last. He
crossed, grumbling because his "old skate" was
loose.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for that I'd been second at
least," he told Jimmy, as they skated back to the
starting line. Lewis always had excuses, and
most of the time he believed them himself.</p>

<p>Next came the half mile race, which brought
out seven fellows, among them Frank. Just as
the skaters were getting set for the start, Chip
Dixon glided over to Mr. Parks. "I've entered,"
he said, "and want to start."</p>

<p>"When did you enter?" said Mr. Parks. "I
didn't notice your name."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"I put my name down this afternoon; didn't
think I could skate till just now because I had a
bad knee where a puck hit me."</p>

<p>Mr. Parks looked undecided. He did not like
Dixon, and was convinced that he had held off
till the last moment deliberately so as to spring
himself as something of a surprise, and maybe
gain some advantage in it. So he turned to the
row of skaters, who were standing on the mark
and put the question to them:</p>

<p>"Are you willing he should enter the race,
boys?"</p>

<p>Chip's unpopularity showed itself in the hesitation
of the fellows in speaking up. They shuffled
from one foot to the other. Finally Frank spoke
up:</p>

<p>"I have no objection. I'd like to have him in."</p>

<p>It was a challenge to Chip, and Chip knew it,
for he shot a quick glance at Frank and his black
eyes snapped. The others now agreed, following
Frank's lead, and Mr. Parks ordered Dixon into
line. He jumped into place and at a signal they
were off. It was something of a rush at first as
the fellows were a little too close together.</p>

<p>Whether it was accident or not, Dixon jostled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the fellow next to him, who, in turn, got in
Frank's way and almost threw him. Hoppin
went down in a heap and Frank had to skate
outside of him to avoid a tumble. When he was
clear of Hoppin he was the tail of the bunch.
But he settled down to work determinedly, and at
half the distance had overhauled three of the
stragglers. Dixon, Wheeler, and a lad named
Tompkins were still leading, with the former well
ahead of the others. Slowly Frank crept up, still
reserving a little for the sprint at the end. He
passed Tompkins, and was even with Wheeler a
hundred yards from the finish. Then he began
to put his best speed into it. He passed Wheeler,
but, despite everything, he could not quite reach
Chip, who shot across the finish line six feet
ahead of him. As they snubbed themselves with
the heels of their skates, Frank and Chip came
close together and Frank caught Chip's triumphant
glance which had a sneer in it as well.</p>

<p>"Never mind, old fellow, you get in the heat
to represent the school anyway," said the Wee
One to Frank a little later. "Second place is
just as good as first place. That lets Dixon, you,
and Wheeler in to represent Queen's in the half-mile."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did Chip come to get so far ahead of
you? We were up at the curve waiting for you,
and we thought you had surely dropped through a
hole in the ice. There was nothing to it but
Dixon. And then you began to come, but it was
a close squeeze. What was the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, some one got in Dixon's way and Dixon
ran into him and knocked him into my way, and
I nearly fell over him and lost ten yards on account
of it."</p>

<p>"I'll bet a pair of my best socks it wasn't an
accident. Hoppin and Chip are great friends.
I'll bet it was all cooked up to throw you."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Frank. "He wouldn't
be as mean as that. I haven't hurt him." But
the Wee One held his own opinion.</p>

<p>The mile heat trial brought out some good racing,
and Hasbrook was the victor. Connor and
Day finished second and third. They were two
Juniors who were not identified with any athletics,
but they showed themselves capable of
making a good race.</p>

<p>At the gymnasium, after the trials, the names
of the candidates were posted prominently as
follows:</p>

<p>100 yards&mdash;Turner, Hillard, Robbins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Half-mile&mdash;Dixon, Wheeler, Armstrong.</p>

<p>Mile&mdash;Hasbrook, Connor, Day.</p>

<p>"And now," said the master, "I have a little
announcement to make. I have just sent this information
to Warwick, also. You will be pleased
to learn that there are to be three very handsome
cups for the winners of these three events. They
are to be suitably engraved and awarded after
the races. I assure you they are very handsome
trophies, and the winners will not only bring
honor to the school, but will have something to
remember the event by. The giver of the cups
is our young friend, David Powers."</p>

<p>There was a spontaneous cheer for David,
and all turned to look for the individual just
named, but he had beaten a hasty retreat when
Mr. Parks began his remarks, and was even now
cutting for his room as fast as he could go.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XXIV.</span><span class="subtit">A GIFT AND A THEFT.</span></h2>


<p>In Frank's room that night there was a conference.
The Wee One was giving his advice
about how a skating race should be won. It
was his notion that one should lay back of the
leader, let him cut out the pace, and then beat him
out just before the finish.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you at all," cried Jimmy.
"In the hundred anyway, you can't lay behind.
You have to dig in for everything that's in you
right from the start. I'm going to plan to go as
fast as I can all the time, and get going as fast
as I can as soon as I can."</p>

<p>"And I guess in my race I can't do much laying
back either," said Frank. "Channing is entered
in that half-mile for Warwick, and he has
a long, powerful stroke. I was noticing him
the other day. He goes like a breeze, and never
seems to tire. And then there's Chip. I don't
think I can beat either one of them. No, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Patterson, I'm going to skate for all I'm worth
all of the time, like Jimmy. If I only had a pair of
skates that fitted me I'd have a better chance,
but as it is, I'm afraid if Queen's wins, Chip will
have to do it, for Robbins isn't fast enough to get
away with Channing."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd rather see Warwick win than Chip,"
said the Wee One vindictively. "I'm going to
pin my colors on you, Frank, and you've got the
speed if you can last the distance out."</p>

<p>"I'll do the best I can," said Frank, "and if
I can beat Dixon I'll be thankful, because he has
stepped on me every time he got a chance since
I came. And it's natural that I should want to
get back at him somehow."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you get a pair of skates to fit you,
anyway?" said the Wee One.</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place I didn't have the time,
and in the second place I didn't have the price.
The kind I want are those Ruddock skates, those
long, thin, light ones with plates that screw to
the soles of your shoes. Both of them put together
would only weigh half a pound. And
they cost money, my son," added Frank. "I'll
have six pairs when I'm a millionaire. I'll have
to do for Freshman year on my old Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
present of two years ago. Now I'm going
to ask you fellows to skip. I've got a lesson to
prepare, and I'm going to get a good, big sleep
to-night and then another good, big one to-morrow
night and then I'll be ready for the fray."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Athlete," said the Wee One.
"That means, Jimmy, that we are chucked out.
Good night."</p>

<p>Frank was early in bed for he was determined
to put all the chances there were in his favor. He
slept like a top and was only aroused by David
who was up uncommonly early.</p>

<p>"Going to take a little walk," said David; "it's
early yet. See you later."</p>

<p>Frank was not through his ablutions when
there was a knock at the door, and a messenger
appeared with an express package. It was done
up in stiff, grey paper, and inside the outer wrapping
was another, and inside that an oblong paper
box. When he got down to the box and opened it
there lay a beautiful pair of Ruddock skates with
long, thin, straight blades, the very things he
had been wishing for. Inside was a card and on
the card in script the name:</p>

<p class="spaced center fp">
"Mr. John R. Powers."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is David's work I'll bet a dollar, and
that's the reason he dug out of here so early.
He knew they were coming."</p>

<p>There were tears of pleasure in his eyes as
he tried the new skates on his shoes. They were
just the thing in every way.</p>

<p>"What a bully fellow David was to think of
such a thing"; and then at the thought of what
he might do with them, his heart jumped&mdash;"They
may give me a better chance to win," he whispered
to himself.</p>

<p>Frank saw nothing of David till afternoon,
for the latter had succeeded in dodging him, but
finally he was cornered, and pleaded guilty to telephoning
to his father the day the carnival was
decided upon.</p>

<p>"I knew you couldn't do your best with the old,
short things you had, and, oh, Frank, I want to
see you win this race. Try them this afternoon
and see how you like them."</p>

<p>"I can't help but like them," said Frank. "It
was awfully good of you to do it, David. If I
can't win with these I ought to be sent back to
kindergarten."</p>

<p>And Frank did try them that afternoon, and
they were all he could desire. The lightness was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
a relief to his feet after the heavier old skates,
and the way he went over the course made the
fellows who happened to be on the river, open
their eyes in astonishment. Chip Dixon was one
of these, and he noted the flash of the new skates
and Frank's increased speed. But Frank had no
time to give to Chip's envious eyes. He skated
back leisurely up the course, tried a few starts
and then swung into a steady stroke down over
the course again. Every one along the half-mile
was watching as he flashed past, going at great
speed, and heads went wagging wisely.</p>

<p>"Armstrong for my money," said one of the
boys. "He goes like a bird."</p>

<p>Frank finished the half, sat down on the float,
removed the skates and headed for his room.
Remembering, however, that he wanted some
books, he changed his course and entered the library.
He laid the precious skates down on a
bench in one of the little alleys of the library, the
better to continue the search. He may have
been five or ten minutes at the work in hand, but
he found the books he wanted and turned to pick
up his skates. They were gone!</p>

<p>Frank dived frantically into the other alleys
where he had been and looked everywhere. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
were nowhere to be seen. He went to the desk
and asked the librarian seated there, if he had
seen "a paper box, so long, right over there."
The assistants were called and questioned, but
none of them had seen any such thing. There had
been a dozen boys or more in the library, and
they were coming and going, but neither the librarian
nor the attendants had seen the missing
package. Frank was heart-broken.</p>

<p>"Some one has picked them up by mistake, or
perhaps Jimmy or Lewis took them as a joke and
they'll be at my room when I go there."</p>

<p>But the skates were not at his room. Jimmy
and Lewis were hunted up, but neither of them
had been near the library.</p>

<p>"Was Dixon around," inquired Jimmy, "when
you were at the library?"</p>

<p>"You're always thinking of him," said Frank.
"I don't believe he's half as bad as you try to
make him out. No, I didn't see him there, but I
did see him on the ice and he saw the skates, for
I saw him stop and look at them."</p>

<p>"Well, you can bet he knows something about
them."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Frank. "He couldn't
be so contemptible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>At supper Frank confided his loss to David.</p>

<p>"I've got no luck at all. I shouldn't have let
them leave my hands," said Frank in a passion of
regret. "Serves me right."</p>

<p>"It is too bad, that's a fact," returned David.
"But you must not blame yourself. It might have
happened to any one. You couldn't keep them on
your feet nor in your hands all the time. Don't
worry about them. They may turn up, and if
they don't you'll win anyway."</p>

<p>But Frank was inconsolable. He picked the old
skates up from the corner where he had thrown
them. They were as heavy as lead. He threw
them down again almost discouraged, and all of
David's cheerful words seemed to give him no
help. He retired early, but had a bad night of
it, dreaming that he was left far behind and that
the crowd which watched him in the race yelled
and jeered at him when he crossed the line
minutes after the winner.</p>

<p>He felt better next morning, and still better
when at about ten o'clock a big grey motor car
rolled through the Queen's gate and set down at
the head of the yard none other than his father
and mother and Colonel Powers who had come
up for the day. The Colonel had run up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
New York in his big six-cylinder "Crescent," and
had stopped long enough at Milton to pick up
the Armstrong family. Perhaps the parents only
happened there on that day, but perhaps David's
letter had something to do with it. Anyway, there
they were. There was a reception in Frank's
room, and during it the loss of the skates came
out.</p>

<p>"They may turn up yet," said Colonel Powers,
"but perhaps it won't make such a difference as
you think."</p>

<p>In spite of the loss it was a jolly party which
sat down at the guest table in the dining-room
that noon. The term was nearly over, and it had
been one full of interest and some satisfaction.
Frank and Jimmy had to tell in minute detail of
David's great climb to save the Wee One, who
was later brought around to the table and introduced
to the visitors, and he, too, added his word
of praise for David who was well-nigh bursting
with embarrassment. He had thought that everyone
had forgotten about the incident as he himself
had almost forgotten. After the meal was
over the guests had to see the burned end of Warren
which was now undergoing repairs.</p>

<p>In the course of the inspection David somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
evaded the party, and when they reached
Frank's room again David was not with them.</p>

<p>"Where is David?" Frank inquired.</p>

<p>"He was with us a minute ago," said Mr. Armstrong.</p>

<p>"Just dropped out of the procession," said
Colonel Powers. "He's a little shy and did not
relish being talked about, I guess. He said he
was going down to see Henry, the driver of the
car. They are great cronies. He may have gone
for a little ride with him."</p>

<p>The races were set for two o'clock and it was
now one o'clock.</p>

<p>"I must leave you," said Frank, "and go to the
gym. I'd like to know where in thunder David
is. I want to have him with me. He's so comforting,
you know," and he picked up the clumsy
skates from the corner. "A good place to see
the finish of the races is from the shore road,"
he told them. "The road comes very near to the
river just at the course."</p>

<p>Then in answer to the Colonel's offer to give
him a motor ride to the racing course he said:
"No, thank you, I'll skate up. But I wish I knew
where David was."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, my boy," called out Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Armstrong as Frank turned to go. "Win if you
can, but if you can't, it's no disgrace. I know
you'll make a good fight." Mrs. Armstrong put
her arm around her son's neck, and kissed him
for luck, and Colonel Powers patted his shoulder
kindly.</p>

<p>"I know you're going to win, Frank. We'll
find David and bring him up in the car. Good
bye."</p>

<p>Frank hurried to the gym where he found
everything in a bustle with the men preparing
for the great event. Every one was going. From
the windows where he was getting into his jersey
and sweater he could see a steady procession of
skaters from down the river, attracted to the ice
carnival between the two schools. But his heart
was sad and heavy, and he felt slow and logy.
He tried to shake the feeling off, but couldn't.</p>

<p>"I guess it's all up with me in that half mile,"
he thought. "I can't do anything with these
things," kicking savagely at the old skates which
lay on the floor.</p>

<p>But it was time to be going, and with Jimmy
he walked to the float, strapped on his skates, and
started slowly up stream. He had hardly a word
to say all the way up, while Jimmy was happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
cheerful, and tried to work Frank into the same
frame of mind.</p>

<p>In ten or fifteen minutes they were at the start
of the hundred yard race where they found half
the school crowding close to the course, and
several hundred spectators waiting around. The
crowd was every moment growing larger, and
Mr. Parks and several assistants from both
schools were hard put to it to keep the course
clear.</p>

<p>Soon the Warwick representatives in the different
events were on the scene, and as it was
approaching the hour of two, the guards skated
up and down frantically calling: "Keep back, keep
back, the race is going to start right away."</p>

<p>Frank watched it all as though from a trance.
He seemed to have no life for it, and no heart
for the struggle which was coming. The skates
felt like lead. And just now, to make him feel
worse, Chip Dixon flashed past up the course with
a brand-new pair of Ruddocks on his feet, smiling
and confident.</p>

<h2><span class="space-above">CHAPTER XXV.</span><span class="subtit">THE ICE CARNIVAL.</span></h2>


<p>"All ready for the hundred yards race," called
out Mr. Parks, who was master of ceremonies.
For Queen's, Jimmy Turner, Hillard and Robbins,
bareheaded and dressed in jerseys and knickerbockers
with long blue socks, came to the mark,
followed quickly by the Warwick trio,&mdash;Sumner,
Perkins and Hallowell. The latter were easily distinguished
by their gray jerseys and gray socks.
They looked fit to race, and the Queen's contingent
eyed them respectfully.</p>

<p>"Are the judges ready?" called Mr. Parks, who
had decided to officiate at the start. An assistant
dashed down over the course and answered
affirmatively with a wave of a white handkerchief.</p>

<p>"All ready, boys," shouted Mr. Parks. "Start
on the pistol." The six boys set themselves in
their favorite attitudes for a quick start, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the report of the pistol, dashed off like the wind.
Sumner and Turner went to the front at the first
rush. Side by side they flew along, each striving
for a few inches lead while on their heels came
the other four bunched almost together. At the
half distance it was any one's race. Jimmy had
now cleared the rest of the fellows sufficiently,
and was where he had a little wider space to
travel. He bent his body almost at right angles
to his legs, and drove ahead with all the power
that was in him. Ten yards from the finish you
could not have picked the winner, but in the last
few feet Jimmy fairly threw himself forward and
crossed a few inches ahead of his rival.</p>

<p>A yell which echoed far over the icy river and
was thrown back by the distant woods, greeted
the winner, and a crowd of Queen's fellows tore
after him, patted him on the back and tried to
get him on their shoulders; but in the effort some
one slipped and fell and pulled all the rest down
with him. Jimmy tore himself free, well pleased
that he had won. He and Sumner shook hands.</p>

<p>"You beat me fair and square," said the latter.
"No kick coming from me." They skated back
side by side to the starting line where Frank
hugged Jimmy delightedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew you could do it," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad I won, and I'm glad that you
are more like yourself. When we started you
looked like a funeral."</p>

<p>"I do feel better," said Frank, "now that we
have one of the three, but I wonder what's keeping
the folks and David. They should have been
here at two o'clock."</p>

<p>"Clear the way, clear the way," shouted the
clerks of the course, as they flew back and forth.
"The mile race will start in a very few minutes.
The skaters are on their way up the course now.
Keep back and give them room!"</p>

<p>Immediately at the finish of the hundred, Mr.
Parks had headed to the mark up the river,
whither he had been preceded by the Queen's representatives.
The half mile was being left to the
last as it was considered to be the best race. It
was to be the climax of the afternoon. While
the crowd strained their gaze up river, the roar
of a fast traveling motor car was heard.</p>

<p>"Here they are now," said Jimmy. "And, gee
whiz, how they are coming!" The boys could see
on the open road a big gray car fairly leaping
toward them. Frank, even at the distance, recognized
it as the one that had brought his parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and Colonel Powers that morning. A smile
lighted up his face.</p>

<p>"That'll help some to have David here," he
said.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the car came to a halt
on the road opposite them, and a voice called,
"Frank Armstrong, oh, Frank Armstrong, you're
wanted."</p>

<p>Frank turned and made his way through the
crowd to the side of the car. Colonel Powers held
a package in his hand.</p>

<p>"David is determined that you are to skate on
Ruddock blades, Frank. When we were visiting
you after luncheon, he took the car and went to
Milton, searched the stores and duplicated the
skates that some one stole from you."</p>

<p>Frank could not answer for the choking sensation
in his throat, and when he looked at David
the latter grinned back at him merrily.</p>

<p>"Get them onto your feet," he cried, "quick.
You'll find the screw holes of the other ones will
be just right for these. They are exact duplicates."</p>

<p>Frank could not answer just then, but he pulled
the paper off the skates.</p>

<p>"And in case you didn't have any screws to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
fit," continued David, "I brought some screws and
a screw driver. Get them on quick." Frank ran
to the river bank, and in a few minutes had the
new skates firmly attached to his stout shoes.
Then he threw the old ones down and sprang to
his feet. How good they felt, how light, how
different from the other clogs! He took a spin
around on them, stamped his feet, and felt himself
another person, fit to fight for his life, and,
better still, to fight and win. His antics were
watched with interest by the occupants of the
car.</p>

<p>Jimmy's amazement knew no bounds when he
saw how Frank was shod.</p>

<p>"David made a record run to Milton, ransacked
the town and brought these to me."</p>

<p>"Isn't he a brick?" said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"They don't make many like him, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, you look like a winner, now; your face
isn't so long as it was," said Jimmy. "I'm betting
on you. Did you notice Chip Dixon's skates?
They are Ruddocks, and they look mightily like
yours. They are brand new, too. I wonder!!"</p>

<p>"I can't believe it," said Frank. "He wouldn't
dare do it. But I thought he grinned sarcastically
when I met him this afternoon, and he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
my old skates in my hand. But maybe we'll surprise
him yet."</p>

<p>"Here they come, here they come," shouted the
crowd. Far up the river could be seen a lot of
flying arms and legs.</p>

<p>"Warwick's ahead."</p>

<p>"No, it's Queen's; can't you see the blue jerseys?"</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer they came. Then it was seen
that two gray jerseys and a blue jersey were in
the leading group, while at some distance behind,
the other three plugged along. But it was plain
that a gray jersey headed the first group, only
a few strides ahead, but still ahead; and as the
struggling skaters came flying towards the finish
that gray jersey seemed to lengthen out, pulling
along with it the other gray jersey.</p>

<p>"Warwick, Warwick, Warwick," yelled the
crowd. It was Warwick indeed, and all Warwick.
Two of her skaters flashed over the line
first and second, and the race was ended. It was
now the turn of the Warwick adherents to expend
their enthusiasm on the winner, and this they did
with great noise and shouting. Morgan was announced
as the winner, and escorted to where his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
team-mates were resting on a pile of blankets
on the boards on the ice.</p>

<p>"It's up to you now, Frank," said Jimmy, as
Mr. Parks announced to the crowd that Warwick
had won. "It's now one apiece, and a tie. The
half mile race will decide it.</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Frank Armstrong, have got to
decide that tie," added Jimmy. "You look like a
winner now. Come on, I'll go a part way up. I
won't go all the way because I want to see the
finish. I'm going to stand about fifty yards from
the finish and as you pass me I'm going to yell
at the top of my lungs, GO! That will be a signal
for you to put everything you have left into the
business. Don't forget, put everything you have
in you into these skates. I'll yell loud enough to
wake the dead."</p>

<p>"All right," said Frank, "I'll be waiting, but
I'll try to put all I have into the skates before that
time. I may not be near enough up to get any
benefit from your plan, but I'll be hoping." They
were now half way to the start of the race, and
Jimmy turned back. Dixon sculled slowly past,
and his face showed surprise when he glanced
at the bright new runners under Frank's feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Frank simply nodded, and Chip coldly returned
the nod.</p>

<p>Up at the start there was a testing of straps
and skates and the tightening of belts, for on this
race hung the school championship, as the six
contestants well knew. Mr. Parks was very careful
about the start. He told them that they must
not cross-cut ahead of another skater unless they
were well ahead. Such crossing, if not followed
according to instructions, would constitute a foul
and the one who committed it would be ruled out.</p>

<p>"Do you all understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," came the answer.</p>

<p>Away down the course the crowd waited
breathlessly, necks stretched and eyes straining.
Suddenly the pistol's flash was seen.</p>

<p>"They're off," roared the crowd.</p>

<p>From the start of the half to the finish was
practically a straight line broken only by a slight
curve about one third of the way up the course,
so that the skaters could be seen almost every
yard of the distance.</p>

<p>On the racers came, the six spread across the
ice in nearly a straight line. Big Channing
towered above the others, a thing that could be
plainly seen as the racers came sweeping along.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Next to Channing was Wheeler, then Frank,
while Chip had the outside course. At the half
distance Channing had forged a few feet to the
front, not over six or seven at the most. Chip
Dixon was almost abreast with him. Frank was
skating third, but was moving easily. The others
were beginning to straggle back, the pace being
too hot for them.</p>

<p>The crowd was now yelling like mad, and the
names of the racers were mingled by many voices.</p>

<p>"Channing! Wheeler! Armstrong! Warwick!
Queen's! Dixon!"</p>

<p>On they came, Channing holding his own a
couple of yards in advance. Do his best, Frank
could not catch either him or Dixon. He felt that
he might go faster, but for some reason could
not make his legs drive any harder. On the
skaters dashed and now they were entering the
lane of human beings.</p>

<p>True to his word, Jimmy had wormed himself
through the crowd, and was stationed forty or
fifty yards from the finish line. He leaned far
over to get a view of the skaters, and saw with
dismay that Frank was behind. As they neared
him he gathered into himself a mighty breath,
and as the three flashed past him, yelled "Go!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>It was so shrill a cry that the spectators jumped
from the very force of it. On Frank, the yell of
his friend, the signal he had been waiting for and
thought would never come, was as though a
spring had uncoiled inside him. At the shout he
fairly sprang from the ice, and in that one leap
reached Channing who, at the rush of the boy
at his left, turned his head.</p>

<p>Another leap carried Frank even, and then
something like the power of a six cylinder motor
grew within him. He must, he would win for the
school. They couldn't beat him! And driving
his legs like pistons, he shot ahead of Channing
who struggled desperately to make up the lost
ground, but without avail. Frank went over the
finish line fairly flying, at least two good yards
ahead of his rival. Chip in his effort to follow
Frank, when the rush of the latter carried him
past, put too much strain on his tired muscles,
stumbled and fell, and before he got to his feet
and could cross the line, a Warwick skater slipped
across ahead of him. He was officially counted
out.</p>

<p>How Queen's did yell! This time they got
Frank up on their shoulders and lugged him up
the course for twenty-five yards or more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Armstrong! Armstrong! Armstrong!"</p>

<p>"That was some race, I tell you," was the usual
greeting between any two Queen's boys who happened
to be within reach of each other, and then
they fell upon each other, and embraced, pounding
violently on each other's backs. Over in the
motor car David was swinging his cap, and even
the dignified seniors&mdash;Colonel Powers and Mr.
and Mrs. Armstrong&mdash;were standing up, clapping
their hands and shouting applause. It was a
great finish to a great day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The term closed on the following Wednesday
and it was a jolly party which rolled out of the
gates of Queen's in the big gray motor car bound
for Christmas vacation and home. Colonel
Powers, whose business had kept him in Milton,
sent Henry and the car to bring the boys to town.
David was the host now and he piled Frank,
Jimmy, Lewis, the Codfish and even Wee Willie
Patterson into the big motor. Suit cases were
tucked wherever a suit case could stick.</p>

<p>It was a happy crowd that gathered around the
Armstrong table that night for supper, for Frank
had insisted that they must all come to supper
before they took their several ways homeward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
And what a rumpus they made and what a chatter,
and what stories of the doings at Queen's during
that first term they unfolded to their elders. Mrs.
Armstrong instead of being shocked at all the
noise simply beamed with joy. Finally the leave-taking
came and the boys parted with best wishes
for the holidays and with great plans for the
future at Queen's. And of that future of Frank
Armstrong at Queen's you will hear in the next
book of this series, entitled: Frank Armstrong's
Second Term.</p>
